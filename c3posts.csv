What to expect at the 2022 FIFA World Cup? NFTs.,2022 world cup nfts,Wed Nov 30 2022 19:24:11,Both FIFA and its top players are turning to web3 to engage digitally-native generations. Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg explores how the world's most loved sport is exploring what an NFT collection looks like with a price point as low as traditional trading cards.,Wed Nov 30 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Sport; Football; Fifa; Lionel-Messi; Cristiano-Ronaldo; Algorand; Applications,Randy Ginsburg," As the NFT mania continues to swirl, few have embraced web3 as openly as the sports industry. From ticketing to digital collectibles and even virtual mascots, major sports groups around the globe have turned to web3, specifically NFTs, to unlock more meaningful relationships between players and fans. Now, web3 is having its moment on the biggest stage in sport: the World Cup.  During the last World Cup in 2018, NFTs were relatively unknown beyond a small circle of crypto's early adopters. Four years later, between NFT-powered trading card games, branded NFT collections, and metaverse worlds, FIFA and its players are well aware that web3 matters. The 2022 tournament is not only a stage for the football, it's a stage for experimentation in leveraging new ways to engage eyeballs off the field.  FIFA+ Collect   Stemming from their FIFA+ streaming initiative, FIFA launched FIFA+ Collect in September 2021. Closely related to NBA TopShot, FIFA+ Collect is a virtual trading card platform featuring thousands of highlights from the World Cup's storied 92-year history. Like all NFTs, collectors can showcase their assets in private collections and trade on secondary marketplaces. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6387a6410511074802a1e54e_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(15).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Highlights from FIFA+ Collects are priced at $4.99, making it one of the cheapest NFTs you can buy, and indicating what collections are accessible price points might look like. </figcaption></figure> Built on Algorand, the initiative kicked off with the launch of 532,980 Genesis Packs containing three randomly chosen iconic moments from past World Cup tournaments. Shortly after followed the Archives Drop containing more old classic highlights from past men's and women's World Cup games.  The $4.99 price point is noticeably low compared to the broader NFT market that aficionados are used to. Romy Gai, Chief Business Officer at FIFA, explains in a statement how the low price point was an intentional decision.  ""The packs democratise the ability to own a part of the FIFA World Cup,"" he said.""Just like sports memorabilia and stickers, this is an accessible opportunity for fans around the world to engage with their favorite players, moments, and more on new platforms.""  Similar to physical cards, these digital moments are a unique way for the digitally-native generation to own and trade collectibles commemorating their favourite athletes and teams. FIFA has also debuted partnerships with a handful of blockchain companies  "" Uplandme, Matchday, Phygtl, and Altered State Machine  "" to launch a collection of mobile and metaverse web3 games.  The goal? Bring the magic of the World Cup to fans  everywhere , on any device.  In AI league, a mobile football game created on the Altered State Machine protocol, top performers can earn prizes such as Vivo phones, gaming equipment, and Adidas gift cards.  Meanwhile, fans spend their time in the Upland Metaverse can explore a digital twin of the FIFA World Cup Lusail Stadium in Qatar and surrounding fan villages. All in-metaverse assets have been minted as NFTs and can be bought, sold, and showcased to complete digital collection albums.  Messi and Ronaldo NFTs   The world's most famous players have attempted to follow the bandwagon too. In August 2022, Messi launched the Messiverse, his first NFT art collection available on the Ethernity Chain marketplace. The collection sold $3.4 million worth of assets in the first 24 hours, and is being followed by the Time Machine on December 2nd, which guides holders through his historic career. Holders of the collections are entered in a giveaway pool to win signed Messi memorabilia, but otherwise, they offer little utility beyond the art itself.  Not to be left behind, Cristiano Ronaldo has launched the <a href=""https://www.binance.com/en/nft/event/CristianoRonaldo"" >CR7 NFT collection</a> on Binance as part of an exclusive, multi-year partnership with the world's largest crypto exchange. Comprising 6,645 NFTs of various rarities, the CR7 collection features seven animated statues depicting an iconic moment in Ronaldo's career. Holders are rewarded with various perks, including the opportunity to win exclusive merch and autographed memorabilia, and a personalised video greeting from the Portuguese striker. <figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:700px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""700px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/640a5d57f96ed316dbd342a3_WhatsApp%20Image%202023-03-09%20at%2015.03.02.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""> <figcaption><em>Artwork from the Messiverse collection. </figcaption></figure> However, despite both players' comments about using NFTs as a way to reward fans' for their support, both collections lack the thoughtfulness and utility needed to thrive in this market. While the reach of both stars will likely ensure their success, it is important to note that very few athletes succeed whilst only selling branded art and offering a limited number of giveaways.  With a floor price of under $3, Ronaldo's collection is priced similarly to FIFA+ Collect, and indicates not only how collections with this level of utility are priced, but also what NFT collections might look like when accompanied by price points closer to physical trading cards than more developed NFT projects.  Whether it's through providing exclusive access, offering special perks, or crafting interactive experiences to reward their fans, athletes and teams have a unique opportunity to onboard new sports fans to web3. It's up to them to make it worthwhile. ",1697
Inside 9dcc: gmoney's vision to bring luxury fashion onchain,9dcc,Mon Aug 29 2022 16:20:17,"Luxury fashion has long been touted as a major web3 use case. gmoney's 9dcc fashion house is the first of its kind, a fully web3-native brand aiming to reinvent the luxury fashion sector.""Our team is eager to inspire other luxury houses to create networked products that retain connection, value, and utility,"" he explains to Culture3.",Mon Aug 29 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Fashion; Luxury; Gmoney; 9dcc; Applications; Brands,Randy Ginsburg," In the midst of a broader market downturn, one sector of web3 has continued to show significant growth and promise: luxury fashion. For a long time espoused as a particularly viable web3 use case, luxury fashion houses have embraced web3 with open arms over the last twelve months, catapulting it further into the cultural zeitgeist. Gucci has rendered cryptocurrency an <a href=""https://www.retaildive.com/news/gucci-cryptocurrency-payment-apecoin-euro-coin/628755/#:~:text=Deepening%20its%20connection%20to%20the,ApeCoin%20as%20payment%20through%20BitPay."" >acceptable form of payment</a>, Prada is offering<a href=""https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/prada-expands-web3-offer-with-product-linked-nft-drop-and-discord-launch"" > digital twins </a>alongside the purchase of physical items, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana's experiments with NFTs have generated over $23 million in revenue.  Yet though legacy luxury brands are lauded as stewards of innovation, the praise is misplaced. Rather, these new ideas are the product of hundreds of web3-native fashion designers, creators, and technological innovators who continue to push boundaries.  Renowned NFT thought leader <a href=""https://twitter.com/gmoneyNFT"" >gmoney</a> is looking to change that. A significant advocate for corporate web3 adoption, gmoney made his first entrance into web3 fashion driving a <a href=""https://news.bitcoin.com/adidas-reveals-the-originals-nft-collection-with-punks-comics-gmoney-bored-apes/"" >collaboration </a>with Adidas, Punks Comic, and the Bored Ape Yacht Club.

The ITERATION-01 t-shirt is the first of many 'networked products' that the luxury brand plans to launch. </figcaption></figure> Combining the use of high-quality materials, craftsmanship, and forward-thinking technology, 9dcc plans to redefine the way we interact through fashion. The brand's debut creation, ITERATION-01, embodies these values to a tee (no pun intended). Deceptively simple, the black t-shirt is an innovative experiment infused with technological utility, and a high-stakes prediction for how web3 will reinvent luxury fashion; the sector was worth $100bn, globally, last year. gmoney explains that""to me, the luxury category of web3 implies an elite exclusivity similar to the fashion universe  "" making this first drop a major test to how I think luxury fashion will operate in the coming future.""  Modelled by big names in web3 culture, including NFT film-maker <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/julie-pacino"" >Julie Pacino</a> and the artist ThankYouX, the multi-stage drop was structured around the release of two separate NFTs: the Looks NFT and a digital twin Voucher' NFT. <br>  A play on the traditional fashion lookbook, NFT in the Looks collection each represent one of the six available sizes (from XS to XXL), visually distinguished by photos from the lookbook shot by Justin Aversano, the web3 photographer and founder of Quantum Art, the curated NFT platform. After acquiring the Looks NFT of the desired size attribute, all holders will be airdropped a separate digital twin voucher, an NFT representing their right to the physical IT-01 tee itself. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:900px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""900px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6386391bb7490946d32c61df_thumbnail_gmoney_portrait_Full_Final_Low.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><em>gmoney, photographed by Devin Christopher.  </figcaption></figure> From there, the choice is up to the holder: wear it, vault it, or resell it. Voucher NFTs can either be redeemed for the physical product, traded on the secondary marketplace, or held as a digital asset, leaving the physical tee untouched and securely vaulted to be redeemed at a later date. Powered by <a href=""https://4k.com/"" >4k</a>, a protocol that verifies the authenticity of physical assets stored on chain, a team of storage providers and asset authenticators will safely store and guarantee a permanent one-to-one relationship between the physical item and the NFT.  But what's most fascinating about ITERATION-01 is the technology behind it. IT-01 is only the first of many 'networked products', a term trademarked by 9dcc to represent clothing items connected to NFTs. In partnership with <a href=""https://twitter.com/__iyk?lang=en"" >IYK</a>, the consumer tech company, all IT-01 tees are outfitted with NFC chips that tokenise the physical t-shirt on chain, verifying authenticity and ownership. Leveraging this direct connection to their customers, 9dcc plans to elevate the consumer-brand relationship through additional digital offerings and physical experiences, and plot the future path for luxury fashion. ""IT-01 instills a community that is interactive and loyal to the brands they choose to support,"" says gmoney, adding that""our team is eager to inspire other luxury houses to embrace web3 technology and culture to reinvent the purchasing of their items, and create networked products that retain connection, value, and utility  "" not just as proof of authenticity or gift-with-purchase.""  Bringing physical assets on chain opens up a range of adjacent opportunities both within and beyond the consumer-brand relationship. Given the importance of the secondary fashion market, for luxury brands as well as others, digital representations of physical assets can help fashion companies seamlessly facilitate transactions and track items. StockX uses NFTs to authenticate luxury goods; New Balance uses the Cardano blockchain for a similar purpose. 9dcc is making a bet on the same trend; gmoney argues that""people desire to show that they are crypto-native in the real world. They want to signal they are authentically from in our space."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:50%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""50%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/630ceca50fc1ed15ae57d309_ThankyouX.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/onchain-anarchy-in-conversation-with-thankyoux"" target=""_blank""> ThankYouX </a>  models the 9dcc t-shirt. </figcaption></figure> In addition, by verifying authentic ownership of physical items, owners will in time be able to secure loans against their physical, on-chain assets via blockchain enabled <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/nft-liquidity"" >lending protocols</a>, unlocking a new layer of liquidity for assets which, historically, have been highly illiquid.  In many cases, web3 fashion has become a marketing ploy to grab headlines rather than customers. Ironically, web3-native brands  "" unlike their legacy incumbents  "" do not have that luxury. There's no brand equity to lean on, no free cash flow. Labels like 9dcc are navigating uncharted waters, building the ship as they sail. To build brand loyalty and popularity, web3-native fashion houses need to acquire customers through innovative product development and thoughtful utility that customers actually want.  With an array of networked products in the pipeline, that is exactly what 9dcc is setting out to do.""We look forward to sharing our learning and continuing to evolve this process to perfection.""

Abram Dawson explains how 0xSplits is helping empower innovation,abram dawson on how 0xsplits is helping to power innovation,Fri Mar 03 2023 15:22:13,"With a focus on gas efficiency and composability, 0xSplits has become the payment protocol of choice for some of web3's most innovative and successful projects. Co-founder Abram Dawson speaks with Clovis McEvoy about the problems they set out to solve and the journey so far.
",Fri Mar 03 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Fund-Splitting; Splits; Finance; Applications,Clovis McEvoy," Blockchain technology is shaping a new financial landscape. Rapid, direct financial transactions have enabled a new generation of artists, builders, and communities to flourish. Yet, until recently, payment protocols tailored to the needs of small to medium sized projects have been conspicuously absent. This is the problem that 0xSplits set out to solve. ""0xSplits allow groups of people to programmatically split funds according to different rules,"" says co-founder Abram Dawson.""You configure the rules, deploy the contracts, and anytime you want funds split according to those rules, all you have to do is send them to the contract."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1999px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1999px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6402169fb143192afdc1e12e_image4.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > 0xSplits allows groups to split money according to a set of rules determined in a contract. </figcaption></figure> After exploring other splitter contract implementations, Abram felt there was promise that was not matched by actual usage.""We wondered why this was,"" he says.""We started talking to users and learned that the current splitter implementations didn't quite fit the needs for groups from 4 to 1000 people. We focused on building a solution for them.""  Their solution was to put a premium on gas efficiency, composability, and to ensure their protocol is independent of any third-parties  by keeping everything onchain. They also set out to tackle the payment issues most relevant to the creative industries, such as splitting royalties from secondary sales and the ability to trade copyright between parties. Working closely with Songcamp, the web3 music-making platform, the company developed Liquid Splits, which uses NFTs to facilitate the transfer of ownership in a contract  a practice that is now commonplace in the music industry.  Since launching in February 2022, 0xSplits' payment infrastructure has become indispensable for groups and individual creators alike, and has now been integrated into large scale visual arts marketplaces like SuperRare and 1stDibs, as well as music platforms such as <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/future-web3-listening-experience"" >Sound</a> and <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/arpeggi"" >Arpeggi Labs</a>.  In parallel with the rapid adoption of Splits by major web3 platforms, Abram and the team have been rolling out a series of new contracts to cover core financial operations like Vesting Module and, more recently, Waterfall  a contract that allows funds to be distributed in a specified order. This latest contract is especially useful for projects that involve upfront costs for development or launch, with one party, like early backers, recouping their outlay before further revenue is distributed.  Multi-recipient payments are not only essential for scaling up a group project, but they are also a foundational part of how innovation gets started in the first place.""All collaboration requires some amount of structure  be it loose social trust or strict codified rules,"" Abram says.""Splits lower the barriers of getting some structure in place, which allows people to invest in the future.""  Getting that structure in place can be expensive, complex, and time consuming, particularly for organisations looking to get off the ground. For small scale creative projects, the value of which is yet to be realised, this can present an insurmountable challenge. By comparison, 0xSplits provides a cheaper, instant, and fully reliable alternative for distributing income.""Splits allows codified rules to be created for a fraction of the cost, allowing even the smallest projects to not only create structure, but to create structure that is credibly neutral,"" Abram explains.""It can't be influenced by any third party, which is unlike most other types of structure you can create today.""   ""Splits allows codified rules to be created for a fraction of the cost.""    Abram Dawson   Moving forward, Abram says that 2023 will see the launch of a number of new payment contracts and apps, and that the company is focused on making it easier for groups to manage onchain payments.  From vertical-specific apps that address a particular use case to foundational tools needed by the wider web3 community, 0xSplits' overarching mission is to put programmable payments into the hands of innovators. The next step will be to see what new projects, organisations, and architecture those innovators will make over the coming years. ""Personally,"" Abram says.""I'm most excited about what sort of creative structures will emerge when people begin to stack and combine these contracts with one another, to see what the community creates with these building blocks.""

In pursuit of mastery: Adewale Mayowa's journey from med school to visual artist,adewale mayowa,Wed Sep 28 2022 09:52:25,"Most of Adewale's friends wanted to become doctors. So did he, for a while, until he went on a journey of exploration and found himself struggling to make art. He speaks to Ola Kalejaye Kalejaye about his early days, evolving from a ""wack"" artist into someone who sells, and why NFTs came at just the right time for him.",Wed Sep 28 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Drawing; Photography; Nigeria; Africa,Ola Kalejaye," There's a common narrative shared by countless artists who have made their way into the NFT art space so far. Artists' lifelong dreams of creative endeavor, too often <a href=""https://twitter.com/culture3xyz/status/1572213998967492610"">held back</a> by the harsh realities of web2 creative industries, given a chance to be reborn as part of a techno-enable art revolution.  Like those artists, Adewale Mayowa is empowered by today's blockchain-driven art renaissance. However, Adewale didn't have lifelong dreams of being an artist. No sketchbooks filled with childhood doodles. As he approached his final year of medical school in Nigeria, Adewale had no plans or interests in being an artist all.  To immediately pivot into an art career fresh out of medical school would be a left turn for anyone, let alone someone who had only ever held a passing interest in art at most. As it turns out, it wasn't so much about chasing a specific dream as it was about moving away from something he could no longer see himself in.""I didn't have trouble with school, but I had trouble imagining a life outside of school. Being a doctor and having that be the rest of my life,"" he explains.  Unable to picture life as a doctor, Adewale spent time reflecting on what he truly valued in life.""I already imagined that I wasn't going to be fulfilled and I knew I needed to find something that felt more true to myself. So I went on a journey of self-exploration. That's how I eventually found myself in the art world.""  Adewale's first attempts at art didn't go so well, he recalls. He would try recreating drawings from his favorite comic books, but the results didn't encourage him to take his art hobby any further.""I wasn't so good. And I gave up very quickly  "" it was just a very fleeting interest. Even with my science drawings back then from biology, my drawings were wack. So I didn't even know that drawing was something that I could be good at, at all.""  It wasn't until his final year in medical school that this fleeting interest presented itself once again. A classmate of Adewale's was also an artist, whose work he found interesting.""Then I looked at his history, saw his early drawings, and I saw that this guy was actually wack when he started. So I thought that there was hope for me. If I practised and practised, at some point, I can also become good at this."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/633418a3d62999112cc6e862_nDagdC6d8Psbuu15D1J0J4uV8tBNrG1tMmxK9qf6juICCLs0FzeTIUBWim9dArui4w5ypR9DI5TGyNxMKqtkj_pehzN58wlyQcsoxEGU9DLxEEZasc2z9GsOlFX_0JQ3IgGOZLYJd-gd74o-AYo6FChJzq5dezyKJ3044hFUBfojHoQN4D5eKgheeQ.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/reminiscence-35016""> Reminiscence </a> , by Adewale Mayowa.""I knew I needed to find something that felt more true to myself."" </figcaption></figure> The pursuit of mastery   Showing Adewale how much he could improve wasn't the only service paid to him by his friend. He also offered practical help in the beginning, advice on how to approach commercial art, and persuaded him to switch from pen to graphite in order to make drawings more quickly.  An encounter with the book  Mastery , by Robert Greene, proved to be a foundational impact on his artistic explorations. It was through that book that Adewale was encouraged to experiment with various artforms, finding the ones that aligned best with his sense of expression.  This exploration went beyond just trying different artistic styles. In those early days, Adewale experimented with modeling, dance, acting, poetry, photography, and digital painting, amongst other mediums.""I was doing everything. I'd try things for a few days, see which ones really called to me, which didn't, drop those, and move on to something else. That was basically how the progression happened.""  It goes without saying, but taking on a self-led crash course in multiple mediums whilst beginning a career as a physician was hardly sustainable. Besides, Adewale knew that his artistic endeavors would eventually replace medicine as his main priority. He also knew how his family would react to such a drastic shift. ""You know how African parents are,"" he jokes.""Before they even knew about it, I already knew that it was going to be a problem for them. And my dad is a practical man, so I knew that if I had something concrete, maybe competent artworks or a definite path with an income stream, that might help sway them.""  Unfortunately, Adewale would come to find this easier said than done. Eventually things were so stagnant that he had to move back in with his parents.""That made it even worse because now they could see me actively not pursuing being a doctor. All this time, they knew all my mates were either trying to go abroad to continue their studies, or do their masters, or trying to enter residencies. But here I was drawing and taking pictures up and down. It wasn't a smooth journey at all.""   ""I did not understand how that was going to work; there was no framework for that kind of system.""    Adewale Mayowa   Juggling careers in medicine and art clearly wasn't going to get Adewale where he wanted to go, but serendipity was to find him in the most dire of circumstances. It was early 2020 when Adewale was let go from the hospital he was working at, as it strained to adjust to the stress caused by the pandemic. But in finally giving him the time to focus on his artistic pursuits, including a new found passion in photography, the pandemic presented Adewale with a silver lining.  Given the opportunity to focus fully on his art, Adewale notes that period as a major shift in his journey.""It was that period I started shifting from being a commercial artist/content creator into being a proper artist. That was when the vision started getting clearer,"" he explains. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:910px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""910px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/633418a3d9f621056dca31b1_vgY10n1oskU4Tg-Su2ElFC7TB6mJa3Ked335f-KUwwyhe4zVDKG88UGBiq2ECjihug-UEjfJ_V9aFMCbt8KeOT81BCy0SJkErd06r-HodQHyHsSz_P1E9wFb2cql7NaNv8fHXpD-jBKP1wEvgfiZ43dAKWplORkIvDVSweajOcVUT1zDzTEHIN_a1w.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://foundation.app/@adewalemayowa/foundation/106865""> Curiosity V </a> , by Adewale Mayowa.""I'd try things for a few days, see which ones really called to me, which didn't, drop those, and move on to something else."" </figcaption></figure> How do NFTs play into his story?   Before hearing about NFTs, Adewale had a strong sense of what he wanted his career to look like, even if some of the details were in some need of being worked out.""While I was doing all of this exploration and getting better at what I was doing, I knew I did not want to have to work commercially, I did not want to have to be commissioned to work. I wanted to be free to create my own stories, pour my own ideas into the world. And somehow, that was going to lead to me getting paid."" ""I did not understand how that was going to work; there was no framework for that kind of system."" What might have previously seemed like an unrealistic expectation for a new artist now looked like an attainable path thanks to the technology Adewale was just about to hear about. The world over, blockchain has enabled artists to go <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/violetta-zironi#:~:text=Speaking%20to%20Clovis%20McEvoy%2C%20she%20explains%20how%20web3%20has%20enabled%20her%20to%20%E2%80%9Cfind%20my%20people%E2%80%9D%20and%20truly%20create%20the%20music%20that%20she%20wants%20to%20create."">directly to communities</a> who love the stories that they are trying to tell.  Adewale's introduction was initially less positive.""Mostly when there's a dip in the market and everywhere is red and people are panicking - you get to hear about crypto then. I just knew that there was some form of internet money that people were dabbling into.""  Things really changed for him when he joined Twitter and began sharing his art and connecting with other artists.""They share their art and once in a while I'll see them complain about gas prices. I'm like, What the heck is gas?'""  It didn't take Adewale long to catch on. He notes <a href=""https://twitter.com/surrealistshay"" >Shay The Surrealist</a> as the first artist he actually saw make a sale. After that there was no going back.""I started doing a lot of research around June, July 2021. I started finding more and more artists who were into this NFT thing. At the time, I had resumed work, but my work was supposed to end in August. I was like, after work ends, I'm going to pour everything into this.""   ""It's hard finding your footing in here, especially when you're not thinking long term.""    Adewale Mayowa  ""When I heard about NFTs, it seemed like this was finally a way for me to be myself, create my art, and just get paid for that."" Digital artists forming community and getting paid, receiving royalties for secondary sales: NFTs were a dream come true for Adewale. And the dream couldn't have presented itself at a better time. ""If there were no NFTs, I was ready to be poor for the next five years while developing my craft.

"After Instagram, is web3 the next oasis for street photographers?",after instagram is web3 the next oasis for street photographers,Wed Feb 01 2023 11:12:50,"The trend towards vertical video Lea Rose Emeryves still photographers in the dark, and street photography has suffered more than most. Preetam Kaushik explores whether web3 is providing a new home for the niche, and whether their artists can find the recognition they deserve. ",Wed Feb 01 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Street-Photography; Photography,Preetam," Imagine that you are a photographer in 2019. You just uploaded your favourite photo in months on Instagram. As the hours pass by, your post garners the attention of your community. Your work is recognised and you gain valuable feedback from the comments. More people show interest in your exploits and start to follow your photography account. Now, fast forward to today.  In 2023, most of the exposure on Instagram is directed towards short-form video content. Art forms like still photography are beginning to diminish in popularity and engagement simply because that is how the platform chose, or was forced, to evolve.  Instagram used to be the go-to community for photographers to share their work, gain feedback, earn clients, and grow as artists. The same platform now rewards video clip creators, put under pressure by TikTok, whose short-form vertical video innovation shocked Instagram, YouTube, and others into following suit, as well as helping the Chinese-made app to <a href=""https://www.4media-group.com/blog/digital/short-form-video-taking-over-social-media/"" >displace Google</a> as the most visited website in the world. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63da609292483225f7158620_d.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://sammyabrata.eth.co/_/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/77880343441441824581090406099038781538338001840329207874185158525845478834177"" > DISPARITY </a> , by Sammya Brata.""This image, captured in Kolkata, West Bengal, shows two underprivileged children from the slums carrying the faces of Goddesses that they've picked up from the river Hooghly.""  </figcaption></figure> Today, Instagram's algorithm-driven feeds incentivise video content, and the creators who make it, over everything else. As Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, <a href=""https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1410297743285829632"" >put it</a>:""We are no longer a photo-sharing app."" Instagram today is focusing on four things, he explains: creators, video, shopping, and messaging.  While this has allowed other genres of photography  such as product, lifestyle, and fashion  to thrive, this shift in the algorithm has alienated a significant portion of the photography community. Photos only get a fraction of the exposure that the platform has to offer, which has prompted photographers to seek alternative mediums for them to share their work and make a living.   ""Street photography has never been rewarding enough when it comes to the commercial aspect.""     Sammya Brata   Not surprisingly, some of them have turned to web3. Their adoption of blockchain technology as the medium for digital art is beginning to paint the photographic landscape in a new light. Street photographer Sammya Brata cautions,  ""I won't necessarily say that web3 is the new Instagram,"" but he is highly optimistic about how it may evolve in the future.""It is already a very powerful photo-sharing platform in spite of the fact that we are still very early,"" Sammya adds. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63da60190bfab70d62457099_floating%20dreams.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""http://Floating Dreams, by Sammya Brata.

This image shows children revelling in the flooded streets of Kolkata. </figcaption></figure> By minting their art as NFTs, photographers can, for the first time, verify the authenticity of their work, receive resale royalties, and manage the supply of their digital products, all while not compromising their creative vision. In serving as a certificate of authenticity, NFTs make it easy to sell digital products, without having to layer a watermark over them to distinguish fakes from the real thing. More deeply, web3 envisions a future where every photographer gets compensated for any and every usage of their work. For an internet culture as image-driven as ours, web3 finally empowers the artists behind the images to thrive.  Sammya hopes that the NFT space can empower photographers to showcase their best work and get paid for it. He explains that web3 platforms encourage people to share their art, in whatever form they please, so that the artists themselves can""build a niche audience"". By removing the middlemen that often lie between an artist and their customers (with web3, artists can go directly to the market), artists are able to reach the entire world.  And this global market is designed to reward artists for finding their niche and community.""Public forums are essentially turning out to be an artist's portfolio,"" Sammya explains, but this is a portfolio that actively attracts the right audience, as well as passively delighting it. That presents huge opportunities for street photographers, who have always found it difficult to compete in the global photography market. ""In spite of its inherent charm, street photography has never been rewarding enough when it comes to the commercial aspect,"" Sammya explains, noting that, whilst commercial photos emphasise the visual aesthetic, street photographers have always focused on drawing beauty out of images that are not necessarily the most eye-catching.   ""We will see more iconic street photographers entering this space.""    Sammya Brata  ""The beauty of street photography is in its potential to unveil astonishing perspectives and interpretations of an otherwise drab and mundane scenario,"" Sammya continues. But, despite the talent needed to turn something ordinary into something extraordinary, this means that the best street photography may not necessarily look as conventionally attractive as, say, regular fashion photography, and, therefore, has not been as lucrative for its creators.  In web3, Sammya has been able to find his niche.""We see collectors taking active interest in this form of photography,"" he says, noting that, from it, he hopes, street photographers could find a route to a sustainable livelihood without compromising on their artistry.""I am sure we will see more iconic street photographers entering this space.""

Recalling a time when his father once built a small 'circle house', where nothing inside was a straight line, he explains how his parents taught him to cross defined borders.""They showed me that the biggest limitation is often your imagination.""  That pursuit of creativity has seen Agoria through a stellar musical career, releasing five albums, some with Universal Music and Virgin Records. It all started when he discovered electronic music aged 17  and participating in the rave parties that often come with it.""I was addicted to buying and playing records,"" he laughs.  Together with his friends he organised gatherings and named them agora', meaning meeting place' in ancient Greek. The name Agoria was born.""Those were very exciting times.

This is how Agoria looks back at the rave parties of the nineties.""In those moments, there was no talk of politics, there were no phones, and there was not this idea of 'just one rockstar',"" he explains.""You were not dancing in front of the DJ and praising him specifically: everybody was equal. You were all just hanging out together and this ambience was incredible. I have missed that feeling ever since, until I stumbled upon web3.""  He argues that web3 is the new arena of cultural individuality and belonging, following on from the techno rave parties that closed out the last millenia.""I think web3 is now the last space of freedom,"" he emphasises.""The possibilities are endless and the sense of community is exactly what I think is so important. It is also a challenging territory, but that is what you get if there is total freedom.""  And having cut his teeth in techno, Agoria has been through the full lifecycle of niche community to mainstream phenomena.""Back then techno was new, upcoming, and the majority of people categorised it as a phase that would not last. You see the same happening with web3 now.""   ""I have missed that feeling ever since, until I stumbled upon web3.""    Agoria   HempFM marked Sebastien's first project on the blockchain and an early output of Agoria's interest in biological generative art. Created in collaboration with scientist Nicolas Desprat, it broadcasts the real time growth of hemp cells in a hemp field that can be seen as a living creature. Generated by data extracted at Chateau du Marais, an 18th century castle south west of Paris, HempFM examines the plant ecosystem at a microscopic level. ""We found things nobody had ever seen before and made a visual language plus soundscape of the hemp.""

He explains that one of the beautiful things of web3 artistry is that the divides between different mediums fall away.""Everybody is an artist, instead of only a musician or photographer, for example."" Actors like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/laurence-fuller"" >Laurence Fuller</a>, who made his name in Hollywood, have succeeded in web3 as poets; musicians like <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/inna-modja"" >Inna Modja</a>, who recorded top 10 hits with Warner Music, are known in web3 more for their photography.  Agoria's works explore sounds and visuals at the same time, using nature and science to seek and show hidden beauty.""For me an artist is creating something for others to see and experience. An artist shares the riveting beauty of the world around us and that can be done in any medium."" He adds,""The most important thing for me is that you need to know what you want to say and hence what you want to share. If it is not saying anything, then I am not interested in it.""<br>  How to raise your voice in an age full of endless content though?""In our current society it is definitely easy to be disenchanted by the digital world,"" Agoria ponders, continuing,""most of what we see around us is human ego screaming for attention, trying to show how cool, rich, or successful one is. Web3 is changing that perspective. It is enabling us to come together and create, to share and to support. This is how the digital age should be, instead of creating big gaps between people.""  Agoria took more than a year to craft his next series, {Compend-AI}. A collection of just eight pieces, he spent the time capturing as much of his own artistic styles, outputs, and human gestures to create a database that he could feed to an AI programme in order to create new art fully in his own style. ""We revealed an invisible culture. We tricked the algorithm to reveal new data materials: in the intricacies between each remnant, an augmented intelligence cruised among the pigments and exposed what the human eye could not see before. {Compend-AI} presents those unseen dimensions that are so enchanting.""  AI art is <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/ai-and-the-role-of-artists"">not without controversy</a>, though Agoria's perspective is a positive one.""AI enables us so much. I understand the controversy but I believe the results are still very much dependent on the input. The same with music, with art you can easily see if it is made with the AI tool only,"" he explains.""Creativity of the arts will always have the upper hand, to show new, exciting, and specific works. If you bring your own database to an AI tool, you are the only one who can make something special from it.""  {Compend-AI} became the bedrock of Agoria's collaboration with Ledger, after cold wallet company launched its NFT marketplace in autumn 2022 with his piece  {Compend-AI-SX} 2022 #1 . Divided in 10,082 pieces, the result is a combination of primordial patterns that, explains Agoria,""is reminiscent of the origin of life."" The idea is that in fractionalising the artwork, Agoria wants to encourage people to find each other, connect, and grow, without complex barriers to entry. This way of collaboration is what Agoria misses in web2.""There is no algorithmic filtering and therefore only the artistic value comes to the surface. Any young artist should embrace this.""   ""By exploring the inside, one can better appreciate the outside.""  <em> Agoria   The contrast between code and the life is imperative for Agoria. Forced to categorise his art, he uses the phrase Biological Generative Art'.""I am interested in the hybrid system between the organic and AI,"" he says, explaining how he goes deep within to see what is inside.""All my works are investigating what is hidden to our eyes, because the invisible is what is ultimately needed to give the full perspective on the subject. By exploring the inside, one can better appreciate the outside.""<br>  What Agoria ultimately wants to bring to light is the beauty that has never been seen before but which is fundamentally part of our environment.""I'm constantly looking for the presence of life. How do we find what was previously hidden? And how do you subsequently know if you have seen everything that is inside something? This makes my quest even more interesting. I cannot wait to see what else will come to the surface."" ",2521
How AI is changing the role of artists,ai and the role of artists,Mon Nov 14 2022 18:42:26,"Artificial intelligence presents immense challenge and opportunity to artists, and the change looks today as if it could impact every step in the artistic process. Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg speaks to Francien Krieg, Artificial Bob, and Henry Daubrez to investigate how they use AI today and how they feel about its future impact.",Sun Nov 13 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Ai,Ai-Art; Artistry,Randy Ginsburg," Art has always been about the creative process more than the final product. With the rise of AI image generation tools like DALL∑E-2 and Stable Diffusion, artificial intelligence is beginning to play a larger role in the creation of art. While some artists leverage AI to better realise their vision, others are producing works that are entirely generated by software.  This disruption is forcing many creatives to find new ways to create meaningful artworks that stand out in a world where algorithms can create art that looks just as good, if not better, than humans.  This creates a significant question: if artificial intelligence eliminates the barrier to entry for digital artists, how does this affect the livelihoods and careers of talented creators across the globe?  For <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/francien-krieg"" >Francien Krieg</a>, who has pursued her talent as an oil painter and visual artist for a career over the past 25 years, the evolution of AI art proved troublesome at first. Only until experimenting with the technology did she recognise these tools as enhancers rather than threats. Still, scepticism aside, the transition has not come without pain. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:952px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""952px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63728e7421941a0005edad44_cutout-memories.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://www.francienkrieg.com/workszoom/4886501/cutout-memories#/""> Cutout memories </a> , AI art by Francien Krieg. </figcaption></figure>""It's a love-hate relationship. It was mind-blowing to see how I could make images with the same emotional impact as my oil paintings, but much faster and easier,"" Francien explains.""However, I felt frustrated because with AI I got the rush of creating masterpieces 10 times per day, whereas with my oil paintings I became more insecure because the process was too slow. I am now trying to get back on my feet with oil paintings while still integrating AI art as a reference.""  The Dutch painter is also conscious of a paradigmatic shift in how artists are labeled. While many artists previously donned clear-cut titles as painters, sculptors, or photographers, these lines are becoming increasingly blurred  if not disappearing altogether. ""All the disciplines are merging, and it's amazing. It proves more and more that art is about the concept and the message that the artist wants to tell. The technique doesn't really matter.""  The Czech Republic's <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/artificial-bob"" >Artificial Bob</a> is living proof. Over the last few years, he has built a flourishing career using these new technologies to shape his work. In his eyes, the shift is inevitable.""Artists should either consider AI as a new tool in their workflow or ignore it completely. If traditional artists are willing to give it a shot, it can open a lot of doors for them. But standing in the way of a runaway train is completely pointless."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62d72a56107abcde7cffee33_funny%20human%20society.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/42718922272498797793179843584144976306418572006083279170760606280134879608833""> Funny human society </a> , by Artificial Bob. </figcaption></figure> As for the worries about whether human artistic will be crowded out, he is confident that real quality will always rise to the surface.""Talented artists who have their own style and ideas will still be in demand, but for those who don't have original ideas, it will be hard,"" he suggests, adding that""anyone can create artwork, but few can find their style, which is not easy.""  Still, it's not all sunshine and computer-generated rainbows. Along with the many applications of AI, there are a fair share of ethical issues, particularly around copyright and ownership.  All AI generation tools are trained on massive data sets of artwork, photographs, paintings and more. It is these initial inspirations that fuel the end artwork users see on their screen. But with this magical output, comes a very important question. If the resulting artwork is derived from the works of many artists,  who owns the work?  Should an artist have the right to opt-in to include their work in the AI model?   ""I'm not worried about someone replacing me, because what makes my art are my ideas.""    Artificial Bob   This controversial question is very much up for debate. To some artists and collectors, like Objkt Community Manager <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/wise"" >Wise</a>, it seems only logical that the machine-generated output should be attributed to the artists that fuel it. After all, without them, AI would have nothing to learn from. ""The ethics haven't been explored much yet,"" says Wise.""As a collector, I like to know where my work is from. I want to know the original source because even though the end image was created by the artist, there were still different images used by different artists to create that work. The same applies to disclosure around whether the art was created using AI."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:4096px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""4096px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63728cc1c39b95cdd69b14d7_artifact%20(2).jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/evermore-36673""> Evermore </a> , by Henry Daubrez.""Down in the lake where she lived, luring all cursed lovers to join, but as they all eventually drowned, she remained all alone for evermore - Artificial Intelligence and the tyranny of taste to start a new era born in the imagination of millions of daydreamers."" </figcaption></figure> While some artists and collectors are seeking an option to choose whether the artist's work is included in the data set, others like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/henry-daubrez"" >Henry Daubrez</a> are less concerned.  ""It would be hypocritical of me to complain,"" says the AI artist, adding""stories mean everything. Good technical work without inspiration, story, or an idea does not mean much.""  Artificial Bob echoes a similar sentiment.""If someone uses my art and mixes it with other people's art to create something unique, I think that's great. Because all the pieces will be partly me, and yet it will be an original piece, not a copy. I'm not worried about someone replacing me, because what makes my art are my ideas.""   ""The future will still belong to the curious tinkerers and the culturally thirsty.""    Henry Daubrez ç  Like him, artists appear to be unconcerned about the prospect of being replaced all together. As with any industry or creative profession, they expect that those who continue to innovate will continue to succeed. ""A lot of the best AI work I've seen is from people who are already extremely busy switching tools, implementing new frameworks, and studying old masters' works,"" Henry says.""The future will still belong to the curious tinkerers and the culturally thirsty. If anything, the traditional artists who are quick to embrace the change have a huge head start.""  Meanwhile, Francien argues that love for the traditional painter, sculptor, and photographer will always exist. Perhaps, she suggests, it will even grow, as the sensation derived from seeing an AI work becomes more familiar. As for her own approach, some things will never change. ""I'm still a painter and I think I will always be one, but the ability to integrate AI into my work is a really exciting development."" ",2287

Close to Home  might be Aitch's first move in the NFT space, but this is far from amateur hour. Working with creative agency <a href=""https://soga.world/"">Soga World</a>, the artist has taken full advantage of the LimeWire ecosystem to deliver a hybrid release that pairs physical audio formats and merchandise with digital assets and IRL experiences. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:6020px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""6020px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ff67743d6d4d100454615c_nft%20collage%20aithc.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > NFT artwork by FunnyTummy for three songs in Close to Home: 1989, My G (ft.

Option one is a limited run of 250 CDs and 250 vinyls featuring unique album artwork. Purchasing one of these nets you the album, a poster signed by Aitch, and a digital art NFT. All sales count towards the UK charts as well, a first in the industry. (Muse's ninth studio album,  Will of the People , will also be chart eligible, and is scheduled for release next week on August 26th.)  Option two engages more with what makes web3 special. In this Mystery Box' collection, fans can blind mint one of the album's unique NFTs (there are 100 available for each of the 16 songs), which includes a chance to attain one of 46 NFTs that come with a range of further IRL benefits. Amongst other things, these perks include lifetime concert tickets, an original fan portrait by FunnyTummy, or a behind the scenes experience on the set of Aitch's next music video shoot.  In this way, Aitch is embracing the potential of NFTs to strengthen the community amongst his most committed fans.""The whole point of the Mystery Box NFT collection is to give back to those same fans who have been with me from the start,"" says Aitch.""It's not the first time I've tried to give back to my fans and with this collection, especially the lifetime VIP tickets, it's going to be a gift that keeps on giving,"" hinting at further projects in the roadmap. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1920px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1920px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ff65f13c1601add8619cae_220729_Aitch_Campaign_16x9.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Aitch released the Close to Home collection on Limewire just over a week ahead of the album itself, which came out on August 19th. </figcaption></figure> Taken together,  Close to Home  is a thoughtfully balanced, and slickly executed release that is tailored to appeal both to web3 natives and to fans who have never bought a digital collectible before.

Whether you are primarily interested in limited edition vinyl or are eager to try your luck at a variety of possible perks, there is something here for everyone and all of it can be purchased using a regular old credit card  no crypto required.  While this first release may walk a careful middle ground between web3 innovation and web2 familiarity, Aitch does not hold back regarding the future potential he sees for the space.""Web3 and NFTs allow us to share our art and music directly to our fans on our own terms,"" he says.""Die-hard fans can now invest in songs, videos, and digital artwork in the same way they would invest in physical art. This opens up a whole new market for artists  but also a new space for fans to connect with us and get a little something special."" ",1871

Even her moniker, akaStevey, is a reference to the TV show American Dad. Once just a Reddit username, akaStevey then dove deep into GameStop and  r/WallStreetBets , before she""fell in love with trading."" Stevey soon became her entire online identity.""I never really logged back into any of my other usernames,"" she says.""It just became who I was.""  Moving from Nigeria to the US with a single mother, Stevey, whose real name is Amanda, had always been interested in savings and investing. And although GameStop""worked out pretty well"" for Stevey, she eventually realised that the""insane period"" of 5 a.m. starts, tracking pre-market data, and becoming completely absorbed in that high-octane lifestyle was not for her.

Its value started climbing, and Stevey saw it as another opportunity  she bought her first NFT around July 2021. But despite her trading background, it was not the financial potential that Stevey became enamoured with.""It's not just the art, it was the community. I just really fell in love with this extra part of it,"" she beams.  In fact, off the back of GameStop, the sense of community felt like the perfect complement.""It felt like the antithesis of GameStop   where it was us, the regular people, fighting against these faceless bigwigs who were able to control everything."" Instead, it wasn't a fight; the regular people were creating a whole new world. There was an immediate sense of community, and a group of people whose voices could make a difference on the internet.""I just bounced around OpenSea,"" Stevey recalls.""I didn't have any tools, I would just click around and see what was going on. One day I really fell in love with this project called  Nobody .""  Stevey often uses language like this when talking about NFT creators and communities. She  fell in love . She was  their biggest fan.  And while for some, this level of unadulterated elation may come across as disingenuous, with Stevey it's anything but. There is a full-bodied excitement when she talks about her favourite groups and creators. She is as much of an unashamed fan now as she was picking a Reddit handle based on her favourite American Dad character.  Like so many, she did briefly get caught up in the trade culture.""My degen friends from Reddit who came into NFTs with me were just flipping those cute JPEGs. They were getting so rich, they didn't care. It wasn't about the art, it was just about making money."" She joined in, bought a Winter Bear, and made a few lucky mints.  But it was short-lived.""I was able to kind of go back to what I really love doing, and collecting art just became a good long-term fundamental play."" When she returned to her passion, she also returned to her desire to connect with people with similar interests. After taking part in Zeneca's web3 Academy with""really some of the nicest, most welcoming people'', Stevey began gathering people herself: those she looked up to, collaborated with, and wanted to get to know. Her knack for communication and connection led to a private Discord channel which, though she didn't know it at the time, would bring her to her role at PROOF. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2016px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2016px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63b6c90aa25bd112432a5eb4_7072-transformed.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > akaStevey's Moonbird, #7072 </figcaption></figure>""Our whole idea was to help each other with alpha, networking, and just in general,"" she explains.""A lot of us are people with smaller bags, most of us are people of colour, or young students, like artists, wanna-be developers, all just trying to get a shot in this space.""  One of these connections, <a href=""https://twitter.com/eli_schein"" >Eli Scheinman</a>, gave Stevey another fangirl moment.""He had a Squiggle. And that was always my goal, my  dream  NFT.

""I would just click around and see what was going on.""    akaStevey   At the time, Eli was a volunteer mod at PROOF and, just before the launch of the community's landmark profile-picture collection, Moonbirds, he posted on their Discord about another moderator role.""The rest is history,"" she says. Today, her job title is Head of Culture and Community, with her pre-web3 background in comms and innate knack for connections both proving to be critical assets.  When PROOF's co-founder, Kevin Rose, made the CC0 announcement, moving Moonbirds art into the public domain, she fell back on that experience.""It really helped me to keep my cool, helped me to communicate clearly, and communicate with grace,"" she recalls. The surprise decision wasn't welcomed by all, and to some looked like an ill-considered jump on a temporary trend.""It was tough, but it was an amazing learning lesson. I'm not going to lie, I'm stronger for it.""  Following PROOF's baptism of fire moment, the team has big plans for 2023. After sweeping the Moonbirds floor throughout December to add value to the DAO treasury, PROOF plans to launch the Moonbirds DAO this February.""The majority of our community are people who have worked in web2 and are maybe looking for a way into web3. There are a lot of people building really cool stuff."" Taking inspiration from Nouns, the Moonbirds DAO is designed to boost those projects that CC0 has helped bring into the world and empower creatives to expand the Moonbirds ecosystem and lore.""It's not necessarily funding a bunch of derivatives,"" Stevey explains,""it's about helping the larger brand.""  Part of the challenge in building a global brand, particularly one that is decentralised and stays laser-focused on a certain niche.""We've got PROOF Collective, a thousand-strong art collective; we've got Moonbirds; and we've got Oddities,"" she explains.""But I think the one thing that connects us all is a love of art."" That overarching north star has played a decisive role in how the team has iterated Project Highrise, one of the more closely-guarded products within the PROOF ecosystem.  Initially envisioned as a 3D metaverse, Stevey explains that Highrise has pivoted to become a platform which""encourages the love of art, the love of community,"" without being tied to a specific way to achieve that. So far, that has looked like iterating the website, creating social media features like a username, and customising your Moonbird. In the future,""soon enough"", Stevey promises, we will see new ways to create""a deeper connection with your favourite artists, a way to get some content from them, and a token-gated platform that can be used by folks who want to drown out the house, learn, and really love this space."" We can expect a PROOF token to be part of that, coming sometime in 2023, as well.   ""What we want to be known for is world-class community, world-class holder experiences, and world-class art.""    akaStevey   But what is coming before any of that is Grails.""I know nothing!"" Stevey claims, noting that Eli, now Head of Art at PROOF, is playing""the perfect role"" in bringing it together. Moving onto its third season, Grails presents the Collective with opportunities to mint original art by artists and thoughts leaders whose identifies are revealed post-sale; past artists include Claire Silver, Drift, and ACK, as well as Tim Ferriss and Larva Labs. Season III mints on January 17th, with the full art reveal occurring ten days later.""We want to take the reveal to the next level and explain the artist's story.

Moonbirds holders who nest (read: stake) their Moonbird can hatch Mythics, but only 25 will hatch per day across the 10k collection. Meanwhile, Oddities holders can burn their NFT to hatch a Mythic of their own, but facing the same constraint.  With those numbers, it would take at least 13 months for every Mythic to hatch. That's the plan at least. Stevey cautions that whilst the long mint structure is set in stone, the specific approach may change.""We're working on some amazing mechanisms, and we want to expand our community with care and make it really fun to be part of our world.""  That world stretches from in-chain' (PROOF's term for when the Moonbirds artwork is created by the smart contract itself) to IRL, and the latter is coming to the fore in downtown Los Angeles with PROOF of Conference. The multi-day celebration is scheduled for May 2023 and will be""more of a Coachella"" than the NFT conferences that filled calendars in 2022: a celebration of culture, community, and technology.  With a futuristic venue, plans for an app and other ways to""use the technology that we've built in house"", and a one-track agenda from speakers""who aren't part of the common NFT circuit"" means that audiences will have exposure to original insight without being pulled in multiple directions. Instead, it will be a""celebration of people connected with PROOF."" And yes, there will be a concert.

Aleph: Bringing decentralisation to the last mile of the internet,aleph,Fri Jan 06 2023 17:21:36,"Most of today's most popular apps and websites rely on centralised servers to thrive. That's a problem for everyone, but particularly decentralised applications in web3, that aren't as decentralised as they might seem. Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg explores how Aleph provides truly decentralised solution to secure the web.",Fri Jan 06 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Decentralised-Storage; Cloud; Use-Cases; Infrastructure,Randy Ginsburg," At its core, the internet is kept alive by a handful of companies with enormous data centres and server farms distributed around the world. That this is a weak link for the decentralised applications of web3  "" as well as a significant risk for the rest of the internet  "" is an open secret.  It's a problem that Jonathan Schemoul was determined to fix.""When everyone talks about decentralisation, they're all looking at blockchains or smart contracts,"" he tells <a href=""https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/20/alephim-raises-10m-to-compete-with-amazons-storage-and-computing-service/"" > CoinDesk </a>.""But the truth is that there is a lot of middleware in between. When you go to a dApp, in most cases, you still have a server between you and the blockchain.""  That's why Schemoul founded Aleph.im, a decentralised storage and cloud computing network, with the aim of providing a decentralised alternative to the likes of Amazon's AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. This is where the applications that make the internet useful actually run. Amazon alone powers <a href=""https://kinsta.com/aws-market-share/"" >34% of the top 100,000 websites</a>, including Spotify, Airbnb, and Expedia.  Outages at providers like AWS are <a href=""https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/amazon/breaking-aws-experienced-outage-its-us-east-2-availability-zone"">not uncommon</a>, and take down much of the internet when they happen. It is this problem that Aleph is aiming to fix. A blockchain-based solution at its core, Aleph looks just like a web2 service for its users, but Schemoul has begun by focusing on the web3 applications that value decentralisation the most.""If a government wants to shut down a decentralised protocol, they can,"" he explains.""With Aleph, we are trying to do decentralise the last mile.""  Where early dApps were constrained by the data, computation, and storage limits of their native blockchain, Aleph allows dApps and protocols to replace the centralized portions of their technology stack with decentralised computational tools like cloud computing, file storage, identification frameworks and more.  Rather than relying on centralised servers to power these tools, Aleph leverages computing power operated by global Aleph network, in which community members are rewarded with $ALEPH tokens for contributing their computational resources. Ultimately, Aleph plans to become an eternal network in which anyone can earn from putting their computers to work on the behalf of others.  Aleph's services are split into two types of computer nodes: core channel nodes and compute resource nodes. While core nodes validate, control, and manage the Aleph network, the resource nodes make it possible to run code in the cloud in a decentralized way. In addition, both provide database and file storage that is not reliant upon any sole provider.  Technically, the Aleph ecosystem is split between two types of computer nodes, which power the actions performed in the network. Core channel nodes, of which there are 70, are responsible for governing the network, ensuring that all nodes are behaving as expected. As well as monitoring each other, they also monitor the 220 compute resource nodes, which performs the computational work that lets applications run code in the cloud. In addition, both node types provide database and file storage that is does not rely upon any sole provider.  Since its inception in 2020, Aleph has been used for a variety of functions, including storing NFT and KYC metadata, hosting websites, and running decentralised order books. Aleph has also released its own suite of applications built on the platform, including an explorer for the Solana blockchain, a blogging app, and the world's first-ever NFT backup app. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63b8440acf2a8e7e9b8cb56f_jcIbUfRdhcw9jKULJ-nukEjP6w2juJyumQ_Mf2f19LrOLUovthqRDA29dBmprn8ngx_MzXwMCbvYaM12zm_NOpaz5YjVGoUruHkF9TsOY9uu6bbq5CI4i6_Wd2Z0xsTkVDPMDjefKpTgaGtHLr2pQ1MpAAKpZfHSiKUvjSeBCVHA4HjzHkHVYSUWL_MUzA.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > A diagram of how Alelph's network ties into the broader web3 ecosystem. Blockchains interact with data stored on Aleph to store, retrieve, or process data. Nodes are powered by a distributed range of organisations, including Ubisoft, which powers one of 70 core channel nodes. </figcaption></figure> One application that illustrates the value proposition of Aleph's network is their IPFS pinning application, which adds an incentive alignment layer to the IPFS protocol. The InterPlanetary File System is a decentralised network for storing data in a resilient way. Yet whilst it is decentralised in nature, this does not mean it comes without risk.  That's because IPFS only functions as a reliable data storage option if a node operator is online and hosting the data at all times. Yet as server costs rise, it is far from uncommon for operators to clear data from their nodes or to even shut down entirely. We've already seen numerous instances of NFTs stored on IPFS <a href=""https://interestingengineering.com/culture/nfts-are-mysteriously-disappearing-heres-how"">disappearing</a> or files being deleted by the IPFS automated '<a href=""https://blog.logrocket.com/guide-ipfs-garbage-collection/"">garbage collector</a>' feature, which sees content deleted when it is deemed to serve no further purpose.   ""What we really want to do is decentralise the web.""    Jonathan Schemoul   To combat this, node operators can pin' data to a node, letting the node know that the data remains important and should be saved. But most pinning services are controlled by the node operators themselves, which means they face the issues of centralised entities that <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/decentralised-storage"">decentralised file storage</a> was designed to avoid.  Ultimately, this risk stems from a misalignment of incentives between the node operators who store data and the individuals who want to access it, whether the data is NFTs, photos, websites, or anything else. Aleph's pinning dApp adds the incentivisation layer that IPFS is missing. Whilst IPFS and similar storage solutions provided a means for highly-resilient and decentralised data storage, Aleph ensures that this data remains eternally available.  The company closed a $10 million fundraise in January 2022. Equipped with that funding, Aleph plans to scale its resource nodes to more than 150 operators, bringing further decentralisation to its ecosystem.  As for the end goal, Schemoul aims to be bigger than just the crypto ecosystem, recalling the broader scope of cloud computing and storage online.""I want it to be as easy as spinning up servers on AWS, so you can just spin up virtual machines under the network. What we really want to do is decentralise the web."" ",2008

The Indian creator speaks to Li©a Rose Emery about turning his passion for Disney and Studio Ghibli into a full-time web3 endeavour.",Sat Nov 19 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,3d-Art; Digital-Art; Asia; India,Lea Rose Emery," Few artists make headlines for generating over $1 million in NFT sales  and even fewer would be committed to investing back into the community. But Amrit Pal Singh isn't any artist. His  Toy Faces  have become iconic not only to NFT aficionados but also to art lovers and digital dwellers around the globe. And alongside creating a vast and engaging body of work, he has been growing his own collection with the same passion and sense of purpose that makes his signature style instantly recognisable. ""I have been making art ever since I can remember,"" Amrit explains, revealing that the initial draw came from a love of animated movies.""I was a huge Disney nerd and fell in love with Studio Ghibli. After that, my passion for history exposed me to art history and architecture.""  Whilst Amrit's sales splashed over global headlines give the impression of instant success, apparent overnight success has come from a lifetime spent honing his skills. Alongside his own fascination with childhood nostalgia, Amrit also credits his years working in branding and design for helping him build the distinctive artistic identity that we recognise today. After film school he worked as a motion designer before building up an impressive client roster  including brands like Snapchat, Google, Netflix, Adobe, and Pinterest.   ""I am one of those people who are more comfortable with a mouse than a pen.""    Amrit Pal Singh  ""I started as a designer creating brand identities and digital products. It's a creative pursuit that is quite different from making art,"" he says.""Making my art collection is highly self-expressive, whereas client projects have a strict brief."" But while client work may have come with limitations, Amrit's background in corporate design helped shape his approach to digital art, aiding him in creating a cohesive identity and a recognisable style.""I enjoy both and borrow a lot of practices from the design world for my own art, for example, building a brand of non-fungible toys and self-curating my work."" <figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/639b19a6c18489c4095b7d6c_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(19).gif"" loading=""lazy""> <figcaption><em>Amrit's  <a href=""https://amrit.art/toy-faces-nfts"" target=""_blank""><em>Toy Faces </a><em> collection. </figcaption></figure> Digital art felt like a natural fit.""I am one of those people who are more comfortable with a mouse than a pen,"" he explains. Already working on his  Toy Faces  collection when Covid arrived, having found that people were drawn to portraits and avatars, Amrit's collection found a more engaged audience during the pandemic as potential collectors sought new ways to represent themselves and be playful online.   ""Everyone can relate to them.""     Amrit Pal Singh   After a friend mentioned that the collection might work well as NFTs, Amrit minted his first piece in February 2021. That moment marked an immediate change, not just in how his work was received as it spread around the world, but also in how Amrit perceived himself.""Before NFTs, I saw myself as an illustrator and designer; now, it's all about my art practice.""  Most known for his <a href=""https://amrit.art/toy-faces"" > Toy Faces </a>   and <a href=""https://amrit.art/3d-rooms-project"" > Toy Rooms </a>   collections  both of which are""inspired by nostalgia and a sense of childlike wonder""  Amrit's work is wide-ranging and complete with depth. As with much of his signature style, the  Toy Faces  are deceptively complex. What initially look like simple, Lego-like portraits are used to capture much more. From a wizard to Charlie Chaplin, from Medusa to Malala Yousafzai, the faces feature legends, childhood favourites, heroes, and villains. In exploring his own passion for toys and animation, Amrit taps into a desire to be reconnected with another time. ""Like all kids, I was fascinated with toys; however, that fascination never faded,"" he says.""I use toys almost as a canvas because it's universal, and everyone can relate to them. It is an instant ride back to your childhood.""  The urge to play with something so seemingly simple goes back before his Toy Faces. Buried in his extensive portfolio are 3D letterings  bold, impactful renderings with stunning typography. These were, in fact, the beginning of his 3D digital art journey. ""My love for 3D started with the lettering; letterforms are like canvases, and typographers are artists,"" Amrit says.""I love typography and lettering; I wanted to see what I could do with it. I enjoyed making these so much that it led to me exploring what else I can do in 3D. So in a way, I owe it all to 3D lettering."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/637cdfe121ec4964dbf82f76_MalalaToyFace.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://amrit.art/nfts/malala-toy-face-nft"" > Malala Toy Face </a>  by Amrit Pal Singh </figcaption></figure> Seeing what he could do with simple things drives Amrit  an innate curiosity and playfulness that propels him with huge velocity. And his explorative spirit comes into play with <em>Toy Rooms , which would became of the first collections to drop on Foundation with a custom smart contract.   ""Web3 is all about community and culture, which I love.""    Amrit Pal Singh   But this series all began with a limitation that so many of us experienced: being confined to our homes during the pandemic. While many felt the pressure of the four walls that surrounded us, Amrit rediscovered his love of 3D art as he began to iterate other small rooms. From a hobbit's study to Aladin's cave, a simple room was transformed into something utterly charming and whimsical. In the limitation of a traumatic period, imagination and inspiration took hold.  With such playful sensibility, it's easy to see why Amrit has become such an important part of the web3 landscape.""Web3 is all about community and culture, which I love. From day one, it was an intersection of so many things I admire, like tech, art, and pop culture. It's amazing to make friends with aligned goals and actually build so much.""   And Amrit's admiration is clearly more than just lip service  he's made a conscious commitment to give back to web3, both as an avid   collector and a promotor of artists. In Voxels (formerly CryptoVoxels) and other metaverses, Amrit has invested in virtual galleries and museums to display art of his own, alongside other artists he admires and has collected. His own collection is diverse and exciting, with a broad range of themes and creators. What draws him to collect a certain artwork or a certain artist? It appears to be a mix of personal taste and love for the artists themselves.  He's made a conscious commitment to give back to web3.' ""There are so many reasons I collect what I collect. I love colourful art and art that has a distinct style. I am obsessed with food art, so you will see a lot of it in my collection. I also love nature-inspired art and portraits,"" he explains.""I research my artists a lot before collecting. I love artists who are active and trying hard, in addition to making great art.""  Supporting active artists also speaks to Amrit's contagious enthusiasm. In his own work, he consistently builds, repeats, traverses, and plays. And there's no sign of him slowing down. Along with plans to do solo shows, experimenting with new mediums, and continuing to collaborate, Amrit is determined to keep growing and testing the limits of  Toy Faces  and  Toy Rooms .""I want to push my existing collections and see what else I can do more. There is a lot to be explored."" ",2259

In my particular case, they changed my life""  in conversation with Anibal Argai±araz",anibal arganaraz,Wed Aug 10 2022 20:51:21,"Blending traditional oil techniques with digital tools, Anibal Argai±araz is a Lea Rose Emeryding figure in the digital expressionism style.

They're truly the artistic avant-garde of this century. In my particular case, they changed my life."" Anibal Argai±araz initially struggled to navigate the eclectic web3 ecosystem, experimenting with a range of styles and platforms to find the right community to support his craft. But with encouragement from other artists who motivated him to keep creating, the Argentine painter sold his first piece in autumn 2021.  The catalyst sale was <a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/181870"" >Phone IV</a>', a quaint, old-world iteration of a mobile phone; a symbol of modern communication technology, forged in his signature expressionist style of sweeping brush strokes and vibrant colours, blending digital and traditional oil painting. Like many artists jumping into the space last year, the unfamiliarity of the territory was outweighed by vast possibilities and the promise of expanding artistic talents all participating in a new distribution channel. For Anibal, an artist already proven at the intersection of traditional art and digital technology, web3 allowed him to claim greater control over his style and forge new collaborations with artists from across the world.   ""I aim at topics that move or shake the viewer.""    Anibal Argai±araz   Anibal began painting when he was fourteen, soon gravitating to an abstract and <a href=""https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/g/gestural"" >gestural</a> expressionist style, drawing lessons from artists like <a href=""https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/willem-de-kooning-1433"">Willem de Kooning</a> and <a href=""https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/hans-hartung-1251"">Hans Hartung</a>. He became known for his unique embracing of the classic style, creating large-scale oil paintings with emotional layers and moving textures, accumulating glowing accomplishments and several solo exhibitions in Argentina. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2500px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2500px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62f581e144a9e59ba26c02d8_phone%2004.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/181870""> phone IV </a> , by Anibal Argai±araz. </figcaption></figure> In 2003, when smart contracts were only <a href=""https://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/548"">spoken about</a> by academics and cryptographers, Anibal was already immersing himself in the concept of digital paintings and was using it to enhance the composition of his physical work. An artform he dubs""digital expressionism"", Anibal has contributed to defining the genre as an advocate over the years, blending his""pictorial style"" with digital techniques.  Like the juxtaposition of old and new in his work, the Tezos artist is a case study on how traditional artists can foray into NFTs, crossing the gap with his authentic approach to a new community, whilst paying homage to the classic art of the past. It's a change that only a few have <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/francien-krieg"">successfully</a> embraced.""My challenge is to be able to move freely through the digital environment in the same way that I do on canvas,"" he suggests. In doing so, Anibal seamlessly brings a storied style to an innovative, forward-looking space.  Anibal's large collection of works all generate a dialogue with the viewer, playing with precise colour choices and vantage points that arouse intrigue.""I aim at topics that move or shake the viewer. I show everyday situations with something extraordinary,"" he explains. His portraits all carry a strong sense of motion, with palpable feelings that, as the viewer, you are witnessing a fleeting moment in time. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:4000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""4000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62f65ef3a296b0a7c52b1f77_artifact.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1FBcJBnF31Kjo8zDwJKD38c5qFuZYeju2L/0""> Pacific sunset of blue seas and yellow skies </a> , by Anibal Argai±araz. </figcaption></figure> Anibal portrays the mundane moments of human life, like friends sipping cocktails at a nightclub in <a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/698372"">Ornette playing lullaby to Lou</a>', a girl using a telephone in <a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1FBcJBnF31Kjo8zDwJKD38c5qFuZYeju2L/6"">Morning Phone Call</a>', or, as in <a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1FBcJBnF31Kjo8zDwJKD38c5qFuZYeju2L/0"">Pacific sunset of blue seas and yellow skies</a>', a family swimming in the ocean. While the moments appear ordinary at first glance, the abstract brush strokes and sharp contrasting colours create a sense of action.  Anibal's other collaborations have seen him partner with like-minded artists in web3. The collection <a href=""https://objkt.com/collection/KT1BX6Zfz5SRNAtsFb4fZH7RvErxQsyvV8Y6"" > Concordances </a> is a compelling offshoot of his signature digital expressionist style, in conjunction with the monochromatic photographs of the Latvian-born Roman Drits. After exploring a gloomier style of painting, portraying the mysteries of the dark with his own   <a href=""https://objkt.com/profile/anibal/created?search=liquid%20night"" > Liquid Night </a>   series, Anibal felt a connection to Roman's dimly lit, mysterious trademark, and reached out about a collaboration. The result is ten works of art encapsulating Drit's sultry photographs with Anibal's bold brush strokes layered on top in poetry.  Indeed, his expressionist iteration of a simple life scene obscures a sharper political edge. His Pacific sunset' piece is a subtle reference to the war in Ukraine, contrasting the peace of summer with the violence of Russia's February invasion.""I identify myself with the work of photojournalists. From my early paintings, I show the power games that take place in political circles; the corruption and the social consequences they provoke.""  If Pacific sunset' is subtle,  2001 Odyssey - Chronicles of Two Glances , is anything but.

With many new projects and further collaborations on the horizon, Anibal is only at the beginning of his journey in the NFT space.""This new way of living art is here to stay; it is beyond the fluctuations of cryptocurrencies,"" he continues.""The art community lives and feels this in a concrete way.

How Anonymoux became one of the most influential collectors in NFTs,anonymoux,Mon Oct 24 2022 11:35:38,"Anonymoux has built a reputation for spotting  "" and supporting  "" artists before they're picked up by anyone else. He spoke to Signal about how he collects, why investing in good people matters above anything else, and why""good things happen when you invest in good people.""",Mon Oct 24 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Collectors; Photography; Digital-Art; Usa; North-America,Signal,"  In June 2021, Anonymoux bought Justin Aversano's Twin Flames, #49, at Sotheby's for 14ETH. Two months later, with the help of Aversano, he sold the piece for 506ETH, netting over $1.8m in the process.  Anonymoux's collection includes XCopy, Fewocious, Drift, AlphaCentauriKid, Patrick Amadon, and many other talented artists. But his art journey didn't start at that tier. Prior to collecting, he worked in banking before managing portfolios at a family office and subsequently his own. Years ago, he bought his first piece on holiday in Bangladesh, which sparked his relationship with art.    ""Good things happen when you invest in good people.""    Anonymoux   Early to CryptoPunks, he'd hang out in their Discord with upcoming builders, collectors, and artists like OSF, Justin Aversano, and Deeze. It's crazy to think, but 18 months ago, Justin's work was around 1eth, OSF had not yet built Degenz, a leading NFT trading community, and Punks were trading for $70,000. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:700px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""700px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/635680b37cc1cc9d50e99d1e_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(6).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/hurt-feelings-13907""> Hurt Feelings </a>  by Fewocious. </figcaption></figure> It was here where Anonymoux cut his teeth and learnt how to collect art. Punks was a tight-knit community, and investment decisions were weighted towards supporting the creator as much as they were towards the art itself. When Aversano's work was selected for auction at Sotheby's, Anonymoux deliberately placed a bid of 14eth, 75% above the artist's previous all-time high, because he wanted to support him.  Throughout the following week, he assumed someone would out-bid, but nobody did. A disciplined collector, he questioned whether the auction environment led to over-paying. Not that it mattered: he wanted to support Justin. And Aversano is a master networker, liked by many in web3: his charm, talent, and work ethic catapulted his name across the industry and later, with help from Justin, led to Anonymoux selling the piece for seven figures. Anonymoux believes that these events transpired because his intention was never to trade art but invest in good people. From that, good things happened. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1068px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1068px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/635677fe24783c2680cbf57f_Iay_iavWKb_oHt1jZCcDxMS3pj6mLKVxsHVemR3xnYfk3pWYtGmnQECyVb3tDrep3lmWbhr2kOdS0753iVHP8ClcDg1AJrmzRseJRcTC1nZ3-bsK2Bgkt9RS2o_TA2yI8iF5h040Iscd2xzbWoZpQrtTrk2CplOdeKt2q8TjmYndeSH-mb4Gp_23tg.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x3c28de567d1412b06f43b15e9f75129625fa6e8c/0""> Twin Flames #49. Alyson &amp; Courtney Aliano </a> , by Justin Aversano. </figcaption></figure> When it came to XCopy, it was different. The first time seeing his art was simply a pure-play investment.""I saw his work and thought 'I need XCopy injected into my veins'."" He purchased his first 1/1 piece in May 2021 and then proceeded to buy six more pieces within a four-month period. Why? Because Anonymoux trusts his gut and goes all-in on the artist, buying their work at the right time if he feels his gut burning. If he elects to sell an XCopy, he rotates the capital into other artists like Drifter Shoots, ACK, and Monaris.  The dust from the 2021 collectible mania has settled, and folks who made large sums of capital are looking to rotate funds into art. Aside from established artists whose works regularly trade, the art market can be an intimidating asset class to tie up capital in.""There is a preconceived notion that 1/1 art is cost prohibitive,"" Anonymoux accepts.   ""There are tons of artists out there for under 1eth or 0.5eth.""    Anonymoux   Collections are illiquid, and often the decision of who will be the next big artist feels like an unsolvable equation if you aren't in the right conversations. Anonymoux agrees that there's a gap in knowledge but argues that this should not stop people collecting art.""There are tons of artists out there for under 1eth or 0.5eth,"" he points out.""Log on to SuperRare, browse the feed, and when you get that feeling of something that fits your eye and budget, go after that."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63567ac9326d27a06c0fdd14_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(6).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xfd04e14334d876635e7ea46ae636d4a45d8ffdde/0""> NGMI </a> , by XCopy. </figcaption></figure> In collectibles, rather than buying pfp collections, he prefers to build his capital by taking concentrated positions on artists for whom he has high conviction. He's a top 50 holder of Fewocious paint, one of the largest buyers of Rekt Guy, and a Seerlight whale. All of these collections he will trade in accordance to market sentiment, because he knows that none of them will ever rug the market or abandon their web3 careers. When his gut tells him to buy, he listens. When his heart tells him to support an artist, he goes all in. And when market conditions change, he trades, buying low and selling high. But he is always supporting the artists that he's backed.  'We're early' is a phrase often used to describe the emergence of digital art, but recently it feels like momentum is building. In particular, Anonymoux is watching the Museum of Modern Art, after the New York gallery announced that they are selling masterpieces from Picasso, Renoir, and Francis Bacon to raise up to $100 million in order to invest in digital media technology,""new digital acquisitions,"" and the possible launch of a streaming channel.  This news is bullish for digital media and Anonymoux believes that if MoMA acquires digital art, they will begin with the roster of established artists like XCopy and Fewocious.""In fact,"" he suggests,""now is the time to front-run the MoMA on the good stuff."" MoMA's headlines contrast with today's macro environment of high inflation, high-interest rates, and on-going conflict, and most web3 portfolios are substantially down on paper, but Anonymoux has full confidence that market conditions will eventually change. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6356822e892385c1274480b1_66e377751eedcd10848f2bce0e6ec07d-transformed.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xc35f9da701d7eb4eb1c03bee64ce59bed25784fd/4""> Violent Red </a> , by Monaris. </figcaption></figure> Last year he bought a CrypToadz for 60eth and sold it for 420eth. Under bear market conditions, these kinds of wins are near impossible so the impetus is to survive and wait until the next bull run. Reflecting on his experience, Anonymoux is as assured as ever.""In my 40's, I'm more comfortable with volatility and drawdowns than I was in my 20's. I have always massively outperformed in bull markets and this is my strongest financial position ever in a bear market.""   ""Now is the time to front-run the MoMA on the good stuff.""    Anonymoux   At this inning of the bear cycle, NFTs attract a particular type of individual. Yes, financial upside is part of the reason to participate in the market, but for Anonymoux it goes beyond that.""Justin went from being six figures in debt, wanting to buy a Punk, to where he is now. Collecting art is not going to change the world but it's fun to support an individual and see their lives change for the better.""  His comments hint at a distinguishing mark of the nascent NFT sector. In his former career, Anonymoux says all his connections were just ""relationships"". Now in web3, they are ""meaningful friendships"". He hopes for a world in which artists and collectors ""can all win together"", and he continues to rotate capital into smaller artists who he believes have a bright future, like <a href=""https://twitter.com/monaris"">Monaris</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/LorcanArt"">Lorcan</a>, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/zak_krevitt"">Zak Krevitt</a>. These artists are individuals he considers talented and who, over time, have become friends, following his thesis that ""good things happen when you invest in good people"". ",2548

But the writer never left canvas behind after being pushed into art by a broken laptop.

In his early teens, he first began exploring his creativity through writing. It was only around the age of 16 when his laptop broke, that he first delved into practising art. ""I just started picking up leftover pens and that's how the art thing came about."" Six years later, the artist's internet-powered artistic endeavors are going strong. Something that he credits to persistence, the pursuit of artistic integrity, and, of course, knowing how to use the internet.  Naturally, there was a learning curve when Azekwoh first started drawing and painting. He notes how difficult it can be for a self-taught artist to learn new skills without guidance. ""When you're self-taught, there's nobody to put you through things.""  YouTube offered one way for Anthony to pick up different skills. As did learning how best to reach out to other artists on social media. So much so that he guesses he must have discovered just about every Nigerian artist putting out work online at some point.  Then, of course, there was a more abstract shift. Having defined himself as a writer for so long, there was a mental barrier to creating a different kind of art.""I think one of the challenges was definitely how I saw myself. I had to break out of that view of, oh, you can only be one thing.'"" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1119px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1119px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/630b787fbe63876f3a1e7ec9_MrQ9iBTCuvROlf0d7JJEH-SDm2dZHt_BBw_1WrQNHqVe0y886a9m-Xv3sgxf4poueMR9HvfUJgKqUMBl_nAU0AW9aWDMPEktMyT3AZ6Ntrz8jeBbh-EUIfuVu69E3NZIsduObr-PcbeMzNGAmMA0VFM.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/yasuke-%E5%BD%8C%E5%8A%A9-24097""> Yasuke ÂΩåÂä© </a> , by Anthony Azekwoh. </figcaption></figure> The mediums that artists work in so often form significant parts of their identities, let alone how they direct their careers. What's more, given how distribution pathways for artists have traditionally worked, artists have <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/ed-balloon"" >often suffered</a> for creating work that doesn't fit into a neat and""marketable"" box.  For Anthony, however, those obstacles are just part of the challenge of exploring new artistic skills: a process he ultimately regards as a""very rewarding kind of stress"". As proof, the artist has recently taken to 3D sculpting, releasing the first NFT in his digital sculpture series back in June. Whilst his first artistic pivot years back was driven by circumstance, this time around, the artist is looking at a new way of emotional expression.""The sculptures are really just this crazy exploration process of, how do I let people feel what it is that's in my head?""  More notably, while there are certain expressions that may lend themselves better to one medium over another, for Anthony, the fundamentals behind the art do not change.""Storytelling is storytelling at the end of the day.""  What is important and constant across all mediums is a commitment to artistic integrity, whatever that may look like. For Anthony this means that his pieces reflect the grit and perseverance that he feels have brought him to this point.""Being able to create the truth of who you are is very important to me. As much as possible, I'm trying to convey those emotions in my work. I'm trying to say, this thing you're doing is hard but you yourself, you're harder'. So in a lot of my work, the figures are very stoic."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/630b7880d882aaa35a7f8e07_yjmaysSgBAh5L1EzQVBMsefD_obYOiPp7eWncopmfODQ-0tF_eZPLuUpoMPJFGBI7JrzP5fNsnGV-0lnKtkL062T0lkCxChFe2P3fThSeCY9hpH7UzTl9H6JSEocqPFc5ow5bpailXakdK3_gfOrKBw.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/0xfd7d24cc1e12f005d441222f181a576cd1f2cc0c/tinu%CC%81k%E1%BA%B9%CC%81-1"" > </a> , which means 'cherished from the womb' in Yoruba, by Anthony Azekwoh.

Before the phenomenon, his work came from back-to-back commissions. The money wasn't great and neither was the work. Luckily for him, the young artist was not long into his career when the NFT revolution came calling.  He first heard about crypto art back in December 2020. After the mandatory period of confusion and doubt, Anthony wrapped his head around it and decided to give it a shot. After selling out his first collection, there was no looking back. ""It was very important for my own career because it showed me that all my work is worth a lot more than I've been given. NFTs freed me and gave me the options to do these different things.""  When it comes to assessing why he has been able to find success in NFTs relatively early, Anthony credits early attention to how he presents his work online. The artist's well-honed sense for the internet only became a more useful tool when NFTs finally came around.""I was already international before I entered NFTs. So there was that boost which made the transition easier. And that was because I view my art and myself as a brand, as opposed to me just posting stuff on the internet."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1180px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1180px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/630b78805d7fb4083cdb1816_488H9B5v7x4dqs-uPzlQ0HiyYqRt19kEH8yLOxWcmS6eMqDF3fj-1n6DFL4DSDa20qN4-uCF-a58cCxGP9crpR_THCKYuKVNJ8QuAI5CeEa9m-FswX6sXGVTrDyFbyqeiF8XRBSxzlgNpvEOt5mTRxY.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/self-portrait:-the-death-of-me-27297""> Self-portrait: the death of me </a> , by Anthony Azekwoh.

Certainly not in the early days of NFTs. ""There definitely wasn't a community because at the time, other artists were also going through stuff, going through challenges.

How Arpeggi is rebuilding music-making with blockchain,arpeggi,Tue Jul 05 2022 16:07:26,"Music sampling created our favourite songs, reshaped the music industry, and inspired the hip-hop genre. But it's broken, dominated by web2 labels who charge crippling fees. Clovis McEvoy speaks to the team behind Arpeggi, the a16z-backed startup that's aiming to fix it.",Tue Jul 05 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Music; Use-Cases,Clovis McEvoy," Imagine a space where every song you hear is open for exploration. With a few clicks you can explore how the track was made, the musical layers, the arrangement, all the way down to individual sounds. And any part of this can be used as creative fuel for your own projects.  That's the guiding principle behind Arpeggi Studio, the world's first web3-native digital audio workstation. Founded by brothers Evan and Kyle Dhillon with their childhood friend James Pastan, the San Francisco start-up is one of the most interesting and ambitious musical applications of blockchain to date  "" empowering users to write, produce, mint, and share music entirely within the web3 ecosystem.  I sat down with co-founder and Chief Operating Officer, James Pastan, to discuss the roll out of Arpeggi Studio V2: a significant update that brings more powerful music making capabilities to the in-browser workstation, new social features, and removes any payment barriers from the platform.   ""This is about leveraging the benefits of the technology to make music together.""    James Pastan, co-founder and COO of Arpeggi   We took the closed beta for a test drive and, at first glance, the new version comes across as no different to other music-making platforms: there's a step-sequencer for generating beats and melodies, a space to arrange and edit your tracks, and a sample library to get you started. It's only once you take a closer look that the scope of Arpeggi's web3 ambitions become clear  "" sure, there's a Mint Song' button that lets you export your track directly to the blockchain, but the new update goes beyond streamlining the process of making music NFT' to tackle one of the stickiest problems in the music industry  "" sampling and remixing.  In the 1980's, sampling  "" the practice of taking beats or melodies from pre-existing songs  "" gave birth to hip-hop and reshaped the music industry. However, following the landmark 1991 court battle between Biz Markie, a rapper, and Gilbert O'Sullivan, a songwriter, artists were forced to get record label clearance to sample existing music  "" and often paid hefty licencing fees for the privilege. Since then, musical sampling has increasingly become the exclusive preserve of major label artists with expansive production budgets. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:7258px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""7258px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62c5b3b37f7f9f246a1e6dab_CC0%20Token%20Diagram.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > With Arpeggi, every sample in every loop in every song can be traced back to the original creator, opening the door to unrestrained creativity via verifiable attribution. </figcaption></figure> However, in Arpeggi Studio, sampling, remixing, and collaboration are placed at the very heart of the songwriting process. Within the workstation, you can browse every song on the platform, you can grab any melody, beat, or bassline and drop it into your own project. You can see how many times someone's work has been sampled or remixed, and by whom, and you can easily trace it all back to the original author and connect with them on social media. ""In the modern music industry,"" says James,""it's really hard to sample and remix other people's work."" Financial and legal barriers result in a paradigm where""sampling is based on relationships, as opposed to the other way around."" For James,""the ethos for this project is open-source music creation and changing the standard so that any sound you hear is a sound you can create with.""  Creating a permissionless sampling and remixing culture is no small undertaking and, in James' view, such an ecosystem is only possible if creators get credit for their work through clear attribution.""There are really good reasons why exclusivity exists within web2 when it comes to distribution, sampling, and remixing,"" he says, adding""protecting attribution is incredibly important because attribution is value capture."" Creators can only capture the value of their creativity when it's attributed to them. ""If people are just stealing music with no attribution, that's bad,"" so exclusivity reigns.  Arpeggi provides users with a complete, traceable, real-time, easily visible genealogy of every sound and song  "" a logistical nightmare using existing web2 technology that's made easy via blockchain. Community members who contribute to Arpeggi's ever growing sample library, under a Creative Commons Zero licence, can feel confident that, should a song become popular using their sounds, some of that recognition will feed back to them. When the platform becomes monetised, Arpeggi will channel royalties back to musicians too.  But the ultimate goal is to put fun and freedom back into sampling and kick off a self-perpetuating cycle of music creation; where each song minted gives the community new inspiration, and new source material, for the next iteration of songwriting.""The people who submitted samples should really be celebrated,"" says James.""They signed over their work for the benefit of the community. That's not an insignificant thing.""  Of course, it hasn't been straightforward to get to this point. In the platform's original incarnation, James, Evan, and Kyle took an approach that can only be described as hardcore'. Everything, including the songs themselves, was 100% on-chain, stored in their own hyper-efficient audio format, the ARP protocol. Storing a song as an MP3 file usually takes 3mb of storage (just over 1mb per minute), but it costs hundreds of thousands to store all those millions of bytes on chain. Through Arpeggi's .arp format, you can store the same song in just under a thousand bytes, reducing the storage cost to two figures and thus making 100% on-chain music storage possible.  The format didn't come without difficulty, however, and early users were limited to no more than four instruments at 16 bars each, with audio quality noticeably limited. Today's V2 finds a middle ground for .arp, with much of the data, including the all-crucial attribution data, being stored on-chain, whilst the rest is stored via arweave, the blockchain storage solution, to enable musicians to produce better and more sophisticated music. OpenGem, the smart contract auditing organisation, rates the Arpeggi solution as one of the best around. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3318px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3318px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62c5b13fdee7762e5cc8e912_Arpeggi%20Home%20Page.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Arpeggi plans to build the future of music sampling. </figcaption></figure> In the genesis version of the Arpeggi studio, users were given a finite supply of tokens that had to be consumed in order to mint their track as an NFT. However, James and the other founders quickly noticed a glaring problem.   ""In V1 we had these Genesis studio passes,"" he says.""Ultimately, they became expensive, collectible, on-chain art items - and nobody wanted to use them to make a song because it was a really significant financial decision."" Seeing this misalignment of incentives, they chose to reangle the platform away from exclusivity and back towards their core goal. ""This is about music,"" says James.""It's about leveraging the benefits of the technology to make music together  "" so we pivoted, changed our approach, and made it a totally free platform."" Arpeggi now covers 100% of the gas charges for minting songs, removing any barriers to users creating, remixing, and sharing.   ""We see this massive opportunity to affect how music itself is created.""   James Pastan, co-founder and COO of Arpeggi   Looking ahead to the future, James says the groundwork is already in place to have a blockchain based artist royalty scheme  "" however, he makes clear that they are treading carefully to keep the platform focused primarily on music creation, with the added benefit of insulating the community from market turbulence. ""With an income source it'd be really easy to send funds down to all of the contributors, right down to the one-shot sample level,"" James says.""The more challenging issue is where that source of money actually comes from. Are we talking about DSP royalties, other sources of licensing income? We want to build something that is going to be resistant to any macroeconomic factors. If there's a market downturn and people are less interested in collectibles, we don't want to be affected by that.""  For the Arpeggi founders, it ultimately all comes back to an ethos that places value on the act of making rather than on what's already been made, that sees music as a dynamic collaborative process rather than a finished and static product.""When we look at the web3 music landscape, the vast majority of platforms are focused on tokenisation, collectibles, royalties  "" but we see this massive opportunity to affect how music itself is created. This platform is about relationships, collaborations, and new music. It's about creating in a truly open-source way."" ",2647
Art or abomination? On the discourse around AI creative tools,art or abomination,Thu Dec 29 2022 13:59:46,"The reputation of AI is currently dominated by opinions on how the tools can harm artists.

Following the attention-grabbing launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT and the recent virality of Lensa's AI selfie app, the excitement surrounding AI has crossed an important threshold in our social consciousness. The vast potential of their impact is beginning to be understood.  Naturally, these developments have engendered, alongside excitement and anticipation, disdain and scepticism. Typical of responses to new technologies, negative reactions in the cultural sphere stem from concerns over the risk to existing artistic careers. Specifically, there are major objections to the idea that artwork could be incorporated into AI models without compensating the original creator, whilst creating an instant alternative to highly intentional pieces of art. It is an interesting collision of the tech world's at times open-source culture, and artists who know the pain of being exploited all too well. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:736px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""736px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63ada6756d7d6c9ff9281156_6E8D8F67-2D09-4C7B-AE3F-4D609F963E05.webp"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > 0RAL B1NARY: BINARY ODE; a token word poem', consisting of AI-powered verse, spoken word, original music, and visuals, by Sasha Stiles, in collaboration with Nathaniel Stern and Kris Bones. </figcaption></figure> Those concerns are valid: on GitHub, code might be open-source, but attribution is always clear, whilst much of the tech world is decidedly closed. Fortunately, dystopian projections of an AI future are not the only ones we have to ahead of us. Indeed, many artists speak to <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/ai-and-the-role-of-artists"">the opportunities</a> that artificial intelligence offers their craft. But what is indisputable is that as AI creative tools proliferate, the ways in which we view and value the art they help create will fundamentally change.  In attempting to anticipate how, history provides interesting parallels. Certainly, when it comes to AI, the arguments against it mimic a common refrain. A new kind of technology emerges that provides new artistic tools. Artists working in existing mediums feel threatened by the new one, which they label the antithesis of art, rather than its evolution. Just about every genre of visual art or music in the modern era has faced similar accusations.   ""There is a fundamental misunderstanding about what creative AI is and can be.""     Sasha Stiles   For one of the highest profile examples, one need look no further than the esteemed poet and critic, Charles Baudelaire. Though it seems preposterous in today's world, Baudelaire and several of his contemporaries took spectacular umbrage to the concept of photography during the mid-19th century. Baudelaire labelled the camera as""the refuge of every painter too ill-endowed or too lazy to complete his studies,"" whilst he expected that in his home country, photography would""contribute much to the impoverishment of the French artistic genius.""  Whilst Baudelaire anticipated that photography would bring much change, he did not anticipate what it would offer, scarcely imagining a society, as ours is today, that is overwhelmingly indebted to the camera. We now know that photography has far surpassed the expectations of its critics. It is not unreasonable to suggest that the same will happen with AI art tools. Indeed, it already is .  As good as DALLE 2 and Midjourney are, it is rare that people enter an ill-thought prompt and get a masterpiece in return. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:55.39906103286385%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""55.39906103286385%"" data-rt-dimensions=""426:236"" data-page-url=""https://vimeo.com/785009323""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/785009323"" title=""Tall Trees Catch Wind, AI landscapes and spoken word poetry collaboration, by Laurence Fuller and Helio Santos""></iframe> </figure> Indeed, poet and actor <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/laurence-fuller"">Laurence Fuller</a> notes that he spent months making more than 4,000 outputs through the AI image generator Midjourney before he ever used a single one in his work.""It takes a lot of determination to work through threads of outputs to really refine what you want to get out of the piece,"" Fuller observes. And whilst he notes that AI does make it much easier to get to an outcome that is""good enough"", the many AI artists who are serious about their craft are regularly going far beyond the bare minimum effort that is required.  This is also true in the world of AI text generation, as the poet <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/sasha-stiles"">Sasha Stiles</a> points out. Stiles doesn't see her AI-assisted work as easier than her other work; rather, it is a different process with different challenges and intentions.  In some ways, it is ironic that artists who use these tools should be criticised for incorporating AI art into their process. After all, it is the traditional art world that first set the precedent. It has often been the case that one specific artist has been celebrated for the work that countless unnamed humans have done. Many of the Renaissance masters had studios in which they simply directed the work of other artisans, as opposed to putting brush to canvas, or chisel to marble, with their own hands. Warhol's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Factory"">Factory</a> was no different.  As Fuller notes, some of our own modern auteurs act as precursors to this sort of collaborative work. In filmmaking, the director is the leading visionary who takes the brunt of the credit, or blame, for a film. And yet a director does not operate the camera, rig the lights, create the sets, or design the visual effects. They also tend not to appear in front of the camera, and they frequently shoot scripts that they did not write. Are film directors any less the artist because they are not physically producing every part of their artwork?  With this in mind, the art of directing provides a helpful case study to consider how our views on art will change alongside technology. Film is probably the only mainstream example of an art form where the most valuable skill is not a tactile one, but an abstract one. We can watch an artist's drawing style improve over time, sketch by sketch, but we cannot observe a director's sense of taste, vision, and storytelling in the same way. We can only view the end product, and say whether it made an impact on us or not.  An even closer, though much less popular, comparison is contemporary art. Artists and tastemakers in that realm have long embraced concepts of art that the average person can, and frequently does, find laughable  a prime example being <a href=""https://news.artnet.com/market/maurizio-cattelan-banana-art-basel-miami-beach-1722516"" >the banana on the wall</a> at Art Basel 2019. Clara Peh, founder of NFT Asia and an established art curator, explains how her perspective made it easy to embrace the work of the AI artists that she curates. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1024px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1024px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63b2f72103dcd1985ebee8ee_IMG_4418-1024x768.jpeg"" alt=""Fairgoers take pictures of Maurizio Cattelan's Comedian, for sale from Perrotin at Art Basel Miami Beach.

Photo by Sarah Cascone. </figcaption></figure>""In the contemporary art discourse in general, there's been a lot more emphasis on intentionality, over effort or skill,"" she explains.""There are a lot of interesting works in the contemporary art canon that didn't necessarily require skill in the same ways that Renaissance paintings did. But they were able to achieve certain things. They were able to spark certain conversations. They were able to meet the artist's intention in their own ways. And I think those works are also very effective in their own right.""  The biggest obstacle in learning to value new AI works is the underlying conceptual squeamishness that we have towards artificial intelligence. People love the idea that art is an intrinsically human activity, and that any art that bears the contribution of a machine is lacking in that biologically-derived soul. Any artist actually using the technology, however, will pitch a very different vision: one which sees AI as an extension of human creativity, not a replacement for it. ""There is a fundamental misunderstanding about what creative AI is and can be,"" argues Stiles.""It's not like I'm replacing myself as a writer or outsourcing myself. I'm shifting my attention to different parts of the writing process and utilising tools to craft language in different ways.""  Fuller adds that AI allows him to do completely new things, rather than being tied to that which is familiar.The ability that it has given me, ultimately, in the work that I do, is a sort of limitless potential to tell whatever story I want to tell with those two minutes that I have to tell the story of a poem. I can go anywhere now. And that has been really exciting."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63adad27fca687604ab295ad_E4FtGGMUcBA3FM_.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Genesis - D9 by  <a href=""https://twitter.com/TheArtiqm""> Artiqm </a> ; collected by Clara Peh. </figcaption></figure> AI is only going to become a bigger part of the cultural conversation over time. It has already created the potential for artists to explore and innovate in entirely new ways; by welcoming these technologies, artists could be early pioneers in this brave, new world, one that will need no small amount of explanation. ""I'm most interested in works that are somewhat self-reflective of the technology that they're using. The work can help form a dialogue that asks these wider questions,"" Peh explains. For the artists who are willing to explore, the possibilities are becoming real in truly remarkable ways. We may soon find ourselves in a world where any idea that we can put into words can be visualised in incredible detail.   ""I can go anywhere now.""     Laurence Fuller   As for those who see AI as an existential threat to artists, that those concerns are so widely shared is in itself a reassurance. Baudelaire clearly underestimated the number of people who would continue to love painting as he did, even in the face of photography, as well as the full potential of what photography could be. We do not have to make the same mistake of picking a side in a conflict that need not exist. ",3262

If  All Kinds of Weirdness  takes aim at society's elite,  Reflections in the Mirror  invites a more introspective critique.""People are obsessed with pointing the finger at someone else,"" he posits.

As someone who sees the world through a lens of post-Soviet""skeptic-realism"", Artificial Bob reserves a certain distrust for economic systems of any stripe:""we need to get rid of classes altogether, but I feel like society just wants to create new ones."" Nonetheless, Artificial Bobs use of AI and blockchain, new technologies for the 21st century, to depict an old paradigm in decay, offers a unique example of truly web3-native art. For Artificial Bob, web3 represents""the biggest chance digital artists have ever had. Being able to connect with artists I've long admired, and to talk to them as friends, is an incredible feeling.

" ""My art is my autobiography, my life story""  Awelewa Charles' journey to NFTs",awelewa charles,Wed Nov 02 2022 09:37:25,"An award-winning artist, Awelewa used photography to turn his neurodiversity into an advantage. The Nigerian and one-time writer speaks to Antony Rahman about his creative process, using""regular people"" as his models, and the highs and lows of his artistic journey.",Wed Nov 02 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Photography; Nigeria; Africa,Antony," Awelewa Charles has always had a unique way of finding meaning in his surroundings. Born in Lagos, Nigeria, Awelewa grew up with a condition known as Low latent inhibition', which causes one's perception to be inundated with a sometimes overwhelming level of stimuli. Though to many this would be a burden, Awelewa turned it into his superpower, learning to channel it into a source of creativity.  By the age of 20, during his final year as a biochemistry undergraduate, Awelewa found himself hungry for a better means to express that creativity. His interest in taking photos began with an increased attention to the emotions of other people, with his condition aiding him in finding meaning and wonder in things that may seem mundane, or even insignificant, to others.  Rather than finding photography, Awelewa says that photography found him, providing him with a better way to express his ideas than writing ever was.""I started seeing beauty in desolate places, and in everyday objects."" Accumulating those experiences is what Awelewa believes makes his style unique to him.  The common theme across all of Awelewa's photographs is that they are meant to tell a story from his own life.""I put all of my emotions and hidden feelings in them,"" he says.""They are my autobiography, my life story."" He first started creating art as a writer, but he has since found that photography allows him to be vulnerable in a way that words never did. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63691ee25b56691b82a5b5ec_ac.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Awelewa Charles:""I started seeing beauty in desolate places, and in everyday objects."" </figcaption></figure> He often receives messages from other people who relate to his photos and their captions, thanking him for conveying scenarios and thoughts that they could so closely relate to.""Being able to transfer feelings and emotions to others, being able to connect like that, is a gift I do not take for granted. It is what makes me feel truly human, and never alone.""  One of Awelewa's recent pieces is his photograph,  A Letter to Death .""I created  A Letter to Death  because I lost someone who was like a sister to me, and that was my coping mechanism."" Awelewa explains that the piece serves as a channel for the very rawest form of his own personal grief, a way to mourn, but the sincerity and honesty of that emotion spoke to a number of people who were coping with their own losses.  To communicate that feeling of connection Awelewa goes out of his way to work exclusively with regular people, non-professional models, as his subjects.""I work with regular people. My friends, my juniors, people from my church."" Oftentimes, the people who best portray the stories that Charles wants to tell are strangers he sees passing by in the course of his day. Like <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/tania-rivilis"">Tania Rivilis</a> and <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/jan-baumgartner"">Jam Baumgartner</a>, Charles inevitably finds himself drawn to people he sees who inspire him, and oftens invites them to participate in his work.

I only ever speak to them about what emotion I am trying to convey with the photograph, and ask them to remember a time in their life when they most strongly felt that emotion. In that moment, they become the most unfiltered version of their true self, and I capture that.""  In 2020, Awelewa won <a href=""http://35awards.com/author/awelewa/"" >35 Awards'</a> Best Mobile Photograph of the year award for his piece  Bare (Innocence) .""It was incredibly meaningful to me,"" Awelewa says. Coming from an organisation with 55,000 participants across 174 countries, the award provided Awelewa with recognition that he had lacked throughout his career.""There is no better feeling for me, as an artist, to be recognised for my craft; it gave me hope. it was the ray of light I needed at that time to keep going.""  Awelewa describes the beginning of his artistic journey as a lonely one. The style and subject matter of his photography were rather eccentric and sometimes difficult for others to relate to. It was also incredibly difficult at the time for Awelewa to turn photography into a source of income, as mostly the kind of photography that sold in the area was more focused on portraits and daily events.  Despite this, Awelewa could not stop: photography was not just a dream career, but a form of therapy. Web3 has given him the opportunity to directly connect with collectors and fans who deeply appreciate his creativity and the stories behind his artwork. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/636239982e3489220c086278_QleX2iJP7MXaKoMyaJIEX5W_54865Wk8PcmpevVhjmHC3JeoQNt4Ey76p5XukK9qJBqB2DFgo4rtpJED6sG8nh3g4DzEYdZ82ZtYbKTXEArRQ8QjvPrckKQUzwS0HVEzsc4Jdx1GG8wn9cBTpW-cveBLEQVUyupGlmmDTSeoJYeH14jch3XgsIa6yX2o6g.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/51648094298845807608298979058084310136071157787139919894371643789146180288513""> Bare (Innocence) </a> , by Awelewa Charles, which won him 35 Award's Best Mobile Photograph of 2020. </figcaption></figure> Awelewa was brought into web3 by his friend and fellow artist <a href=""http://waleadebisip"" >Wale Adebisi</a>.""Awelewa, there is hope for us here,"" Awelewa recalls him saying, before recounting his journey.""I have had so much success and met so many amazing people in the NFT community. I could not have imagined it before.""  Awelewa brings this introspective and thoughtful approach to all of the art he creates, and it shows in the vibrancy and intensity of each piece. His main goal for the future is to inspire people, especially young artists, to be their true selves. He wants his work to help people feel that they are not alone, that their feelings, whether exuberant happiness or heartrending grief, are shared by someone, somewhere. ""Don't lose your true self, and never rush greatness. Getting into this space can be a lot for anyone, it can be distracting, disorienting. But never stop believing in yourself, or why you started doing this work. Have patience, persistence and self-confidence, and never lose them."" ",2109

Never to be left behind, it is unsurprising to see the internationally-renowned graffiti artist Banksy at the forefront, defining a new connection between NFTs, art, and utility. He is at the heart of a new collaboration between Magic Eden and LCD Labs ,  linking an NFT collection to physical art pieces from the Banksy Walled Off Hotel Box Set. A groundbreaking innovation for the NFT ecosystem, this is the first NFT collection where each NFT is attached to a physical art piece  and by a legendary artist.  It feels fitting that the boundary-crossing guerilla artist, Banksy is at the heart of this innovative crossover of the digital and physical art worlds. The British artist opened the Walled Off Hotel in Bethlehem, Palestine, in 2017 and advertised it as the hotel""with the worst view in the world"", a critical commentary on Israeli infrastructure and settlements in the West Bank. The Box Set was offered to visitors between 2017 and 2019, with an estimated 6,000 editions sold, each uniquely identified by the visitor's hotel invoice.  The particular relationship between the NFTs, which are limited to 1,000 editions, and the physical pieces, is what makes the project so intriguing. The choice to retain the NFT for special access to the LCD ecosystem or to burn it in exchange for the physical Banksy piece is a key part of the collaboration  and it is a choice that will fall to each individual collector. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1100px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1100px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63049cde8d936d56037637db_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(8).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > A Banksy Walled Off Box Set.

The pair have spent many years collecting 1,000 editions of the Box Set (one for each NFT), and are launching the project with their Radar Rats collection, 1,000 Banksy-inspired artworks on the Solana blockchain. Each of the rats is unique, algorithmically generated with over 70 unique traits, and inspired by other Banksy pieces.  Jack Lu, CEO of Magic Eden, explains that the company is always looking to bring innovative collections onto the platform, particularly as they gear up to compete in the far larger NFT market on Ethereum, dominated by OpenSea.""By introducing the legendary art of Banksy into the NFT world and piloting a unique burn mechanism in which an NFT can be redeemed for a physical art piece, we engage a community of passionate NFT collectors who are expressing greater demand for fine art.""   During the sale, 10% of the profits will be shared with the  Banksy Walled Off Hotel,  toward facilitating and organising an urban art festival in Bethlehem. When Banksy opened the hotel in 2017, he remarked""it's exactly 100 years since Britain took control of Palestine and started rearranging the furniture  with chaotic results. I don't know why, but it felt like a good time to reflect on what happens when the United Kingdom makes a huge political decision without fully comprehending the consequences.""

And while Banksy is a useful hook that will expand awareness and introduces NFTs to new audiences, it also gives web3-native collectors and traders greater access to traditional art, reflecting how the two worlds are increasingly overlapping.  Ozenne explains,""with this project, we hope to onboard a brand new audience to the art market, making it more accessible and fun. We are starting with Banksy, but our vision is to have a mix of upcoming and well-established artist sales for the months to come."" ",1421
Baris Kabalak on the line between love and madness,baris kabalak,Sat Jul 16 2022 11:16:42,"Baris Varujan Kabalak found himself compelled to tell the stories that lived so vividly in his mind. The Istanbul artist speaks to Li©a Rose Emery about storytelling, NFTs, and connecting with audiences through a single click. ",Sat Jul 16 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Ai-Art; Turkey; Asia,Lea Rose Emery," Surreal, distinct, and expressive, Baris Varujan Kabalak's style is mercurial, just as effective at exploring haunting emotional depth as it is at capturing intoxicating joy. His impressive series of NFT collections is no small feat for someone who only turned to the visual arts a few years ago, when he realised he needed to find a medium for his storytelling instincts. ""Five years ago I started thinking of ways to create art,"" he explains.""I always had stories I wanted to tell, especially before I went to sleep  I thought about these stories, and lived in them."" But eventually, living and dreaming in these stories was""not enough"", and he felt compelled to create.  To anyone familiar with his   work, that Baris' inspiration came from the hinterland between sleeping and dreaming, day and night, will be no surprise. His images are often ethereal and take a cloudlike form, and he uses these deceptively soft and malleable shapes to explore everything from the most exuberant, universal experiences, to deep-rooted fears and even the grotesque. At first glance, the striking, textured imagery comes across as a playful exploration of light and dark, border and shadow, but the layering and detail reveal the potential of the medium to go further and take on a diverse range of emotional, impactful subjects.   One of his most recent collections, <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/lostinloves"">Lost in Loves</a>, plays with the volatility and pliant quality of both the cloud-like images and the subject matter.""Clouds symbolise uncertainties in our love life,"" he says. In this collection, the traditionally romantic shapes are underpinned with something more complex. Fittingly, Baris gave the collection the tagline:  You call it madness, but I call it love.  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62d2a13c01683237bef90d62_bvk1.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/57238711872153944072416263132929341812104567567013768714120147782566544408577""> Lost in Love #21 </a> , by Baris Kabalak. </figcaption></figure>""Roland Barthes defines love as a romantic solution to the problem of death  and my collection is mainly about that,"" Baris explains.""Losing yourself in love, fading into love. Losing your sense of the world and surroundings. Love means an escape from reality to me, actually. The people we love transform into gods or goddesses and we want them to save us from reality. And we lose our own sense of reality because we created a whole new, deep perception of ourselves. We become a completely different person, we begin to see and perceive things differently.""  Baris' interests run far broader than the heady manifestations of love. With wispy canvases and shapes emblematic of all his collections, his series <a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/57238711872153944072416263132929341812104567567013768714120147685809521164289"">Lost in Feeling</a> is much the same, but different, boldened by sparkling, electric colours. It's night time, and we're gazing upon dreams: nebulae of faces, regrets, and memories; you never want to let go of those memories, Baris tells us, no matter how much suffering you go through. The zooming effect   used in Baris' work underlies a relentless sense of exploration, of excitement  but also the more difficult, unsettling sides to his subject matter, the other side of the same coin.  This darker side is fully realised in the <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/7deadlysinsai"">7 Deadly Sins AI collection</a>, where Baris' striking style and unique eye unpick familiar topics in a new way. A synthesis of his own work and an AI trained on""important sentences about the seven deadly sins"" in Christianity, the result is surreal and evocative. While the wispy, feathery technique is still undeniably his own, this work is grittier and more grounded. It winks at traditional portraits and compositions, but combines the classic outlay with an entirely new technique. He makes sure to point out this was a""collaborative"" effort with another friend, in addition to the computer, to create a series that""bears traces of both of our ideas"". <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62d2c8207083784cfa9bbecb_hthfffhtfthft.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/57238711872153944072416263132929341812104567567013768714120147716595846742017""> Ego #3 </a> , by Baris Kabalak. </figcaption></figure> Much of Baris' work deals with innate human experience  whether that's love, feeling, or sin. His most recent collection, <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/lostinanxiety"">Lost in Anxiety</a>, focuses on mental health and the battle to stay in control of your own thoughts. For him, examining these foundational emotions in the digital space was a natural fit. First and foremost a storyteller, he knew what he wanted to scrutinise, what he wanted to evoke. He just needed to find the right medium. ""I wanted to visually create the stories I liked to tell, and I discovered that the digital environment was the most suitable area for me,"" he says. Five years ago he began experimenting in the medium, but for the past two years he has been consistently creating. By enabling artist attribution, credit, and exclusivity, NFTs were perhaps the only way to bring his universal themes to his audience.  And this prolific artist shows no sign of slowing down. He's continuing to grapple with some of the most intrinsic human struggles; next, Baris plans on exploring loneliness. Reflecting on web3, Baris explains""it definitely had a huge impact in terms of visibility. No matter how many works you have created, it was very difficult to reach large audiences before. But now even the farthest person can reach you with a single click."" ",1816

Ben Mayor White,""creative strategist"" and general creative powerhouse, is both a web3 native and a vocal advocate. But perhaps what sets him apart most is his deftness at helping partners develop authentic web3 strategies  and his passion for watching the space and communities evolve.  Even before discovering NFTs, Ben was  au fait  with all things digital.""I've probably been in digital social media since about 2009  working with big brands and small brands, being an activist as well."" The organisations on his CV range from Google and the BBC to Bite the Ballot, a social enterprise that helps young people register to vote, and his enthusiasm for every nook and cranny of web3 is palpable.""I'm a Bored Ape and living life as a child in the metaverse,"" he effuses through the Mutant Ape avatar that he uses for all his video calls.  Born in the mid-eighties, his digital curiosity was piqued by the technology developing throughout his childhood, epitomised by the arrival of the GameBoy in 1990. But he was just as captivated by the potential of the technology   as he was by the reality.""I was born in the North of England and didn't have great access to amazing computers and stuff. So I was just always fascinated by what was possible."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:77%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""77%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63223f426d1588762d07d10a_mayc.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > A passionate advocate for web3, Ben built a career helping people, brands, and causes tell their stories through new media. </figcaption></figure> His real entry into the digital space came through social media. First, building a business on keyword tracking whilst living in Ibiza, and then at COPA90, a fan-first football media company, where he was quickly put in charge of audience development for the channel  helping evolve the strategy to focus on native gamers and FIFA YouTubers. It was an early example of Ben's ability to spot the direction of travel, while at the same time keeping the user experience and sense of community at the forefront of his thinking. ""We created formats with them as the leads or the protagonists. We created characters like The FIFA Player who was an anonymous gamer. A lot of it was building up arguments on Twitter and Instagram, between the people playing. So kind of like a precursor to what's happening again now, with different anons online.""  His experience was a formative one, learning how to develop strategic partners and helping push forward the company by understanding how people were  really  using the web.""I left there feeling a little bit like Keanu Reeves in the Matrix  like  I know kung-fu' , but it's like  'I understand the internet.' "" He used this new-found knowledge as he""swerved into activism"" at an NGO called Bite The Ballot, working with Jamal Edwards, the late entrepreneur and musician, where he helped register half a million people to vote. Soon he was consulting for big hitters like the BBC and Disney, before moving to adidas in early 2020. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" style=""max-width:77%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width=""77%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63221dc550dc5a39cef3222b_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(4).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Ben turned his Mutant Ape into an avatar for video calls.""I'm a Bored Ape and living life as a child in the metaverse,"" is his tried and tested one line intro. </figcaption></figure> Already a sharpened social media mind, it wasn't until a holiday in December 2020 that Ben came across web3  and everything changed.""Unfortunately for my wife,"" he jokes,""I read 'NFT' and was like, what are those letters?"" His entrance to web3 focused on the technological opportunities of smart contracts, and he instantly made the cultural connection.""Almost immediately, I believed that this is how we're going to transact across reality, or across  realities .""  He took this passion back to adidas.""I was asking and quizzing everyone: Is there a department? Is there anyone working on this? Is it in an innovation department or something?"" Soon, an unofficial task force was formed, an exhilarating group of cultural futurists dragging the clothing behemoth into web3.  But in the company of 70,000 or so employees, Ben estimates only""three or four had a digital wallet"" at the time, with just 20""actively working"" as part of the unofficial group. He points to one colleague who had known about NFTs since 2018 and had tried to push the company toward web3  ""but obviously it was really too early"". Now, with more people on board, and a greater public awareness of web3, the needle could finally shift. ""It was terrifying and really difficult,"" he recalls of his time galvanises the group in the early months of the pandemic.""As a group of people, we'd never really met or worked together. It was a real team feeling. We were like Oh, if we can do this, though  if we actually could  it's gonna be crazy'.""  And it was. Produced in collaboration with the Bored Ape Yacht Club, PUNKS Comic, and gmoney, adidas' Into The Metaverse (ITM) collection comprises 30,000 NFTs, each entitling the owner to physical merch and, more importantly, adidas' own ITM universe. Ben is quick to point out that its success was based upon the connection and partnerships with leaders in the space. ""We didn't come in as adidas, like  hey, here we are, make it in our own silo'  and think we can enter the space without taking our hats off to the people that had built it or partnering authentically with them.""  The authenticity paid off  almost instantaneously, the drop brought in over $23 million, split between the four partners.  ""We broke Etherscan, we broke Discord, we broke OpenSea. The website somehow didn't break, so shout out to our partners there that made such a great website,"" he laughs.""But there were 20, 30, 40 million hits. It was a defining moment for sure.""  This deep-rooted understanding that those most committed to the space are not only authentic but are also the most innovative, shapes Ben's vision. He points to gmoney's new luxury fashion brand <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/9dcc"">9dcc</a>.""He wants to help high fashion come into the space and he can see himself as a guide there. I'm super proud of him. I love the way it was done.""  The integration of technology and community was key  the fact that the actual clothes could be vaulted or shipped, with members of gmoney's existing Admit One ecosystem prioritised.""It's creating a brand upon a brand and intellectual property within intellectual property.""  And that gradual development  the growing community, the continued integration  is what Ben is sure has created something irreplaceable about the early adopters of NFTs.""There were a lot of other people that were fantastic in their different ways. [NFTs give them] access to the IP, which ignited a bunch of creatives, and people who were probably bored in their day jobs; they all ignited here in a community.""   ""I promise you that it will go to the rest of the world.""    Ben Mayor White   He cautions not to underestimate the web3-native brands that are being built with NFTs.""Remember the people that are Bored Apes or Doodles or whatever, that's not all they are. They're professionals across the spectrum. The reason why Ape Fest and these things are working, is because Yuga Labs raised $450 million and are hiring great people from across the spectrum in different areas."" These early creators have""written a compelling story, a narrative"", but they're also experienced professionals, and they understand culture in a way that Ben thinks""brands will struggle and are struggling with."" ""Now you walk into a toy shop and you see Fortnite, Roblox, and Minecraft toys there  you will see Bored Apes, you will see Pudgy Penguins, they will be on television programs, they will be on Netflix.

He speaks to Steph Kunkel Kunkel about connecting human mood to digital environment, and how his dreamscapes build a backdrop for collectors to imagine their own safe havens.
",Thu Dec 22 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,3d-Art; Turkey,Steph Kunkel," Most artists create a composition and hope that it will win appreciation for everything that it is, rather than what it is not. For Berk Kaan Kaya, however, the beauty of his creations lies in their capacity for addition. His carefully designed and thoughtfully curated digital spaces act as a springboard for the imagination to weave its own tale, and construct a landscape of emotions.  Berk Kaan Kaya is a multidisciplinary artist and architect based in Turkey. Discovering a love for painting and drawing as a child, he eventually pursued a career in interior design.""3D work has always interested me,"" Berk says,""and the creative freedom that it affords has provided a good opportunity to bring the things that I had dreamed of to life. 3D art is my escape point. It's where I found myself."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2500px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2500px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63a4596865aad48c55071f9e_Garden.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://foundation.app/@kax/kax/3"" > Garden </a> , by Bern Kaan Kaya.""The purest and most innocent smell is the smell of childhood. You can create your own lush garden on the side of an old mountain, where all the plants have withered.""  </figcaption></figure> Berk argues that the interior design which surrounds us impacts our mood and behaviours in ways that we do not anticipate.""Whilst I was studying interior architecture, I spent lots of time observing the effects of places on people,"" he recounts. Realising the impact that design can have on emotions, Berk began to experiment with spacial elements in his designs. Using 3DsMax, CoronaRenderer, and Photoshop, he creates alluring pieces comprising soothing colours and multiple layers, culminating in detailed storyscapes.   ""3D art is my escape point.""    Berk Kaan Kaya   Berk's landscapes are a direct transition from dream to digital reality. In the same way that the human nervous system reacts to its exterior environment, Berk's artwork inextricably links his own consciousness to the habitats that he creates.  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2571px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2571px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63a454870f968bc751eeb0c8_Chrysalis.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://foundation.app/@kax/dballs/2"" > Chrysalis </a> , by Bern Kaan Kaya.""That moment when we fly freely from the space where we create our own selves."" </figcaption></figure>""The elements that I use in my designs allow people to think about how we interact and move through different spaces every day,"" he says. But his work also invites the viewer to envision themselves  within  these spaces, enchanting them to step inside and create a world of their own. Inspired by""the fine line that connects realism and surrealism"", Berk's dreamy constructions, therefore, act as the perfect springboard for onlookers to create such narratives. ""My creative process starts by building peaceful places where people can focus on their dreams and step away from reality. I reflect on human emotions and themes: coming out of your shell, creating your own 'garden' despite hardships, and feeling the growing longing inside of you.""  In no piece is this purpose clearer than in  Chrysalis . For Berk,  Chrysalis  evokes the rebirth of the soul: an ethereal transition that occurs when a person is truly at one with their surroundings.""That moment when our souls fly freely in a space is when we create our truest selves,"" Berk explains, encompassing the dreamlike state that is so key to his artwork. Washing over you with a tranquillity and peacefulness that permits the mind to freely explore itself,  Chrysalis  merges soft pastel tones with hard natural elements to create a whirl of whimsicality.  Berk's  Miss , on the other hand, carries the mind to an otherworldly luxury resort. The image of a beautiful arched building gives an elegance to the piece, while the overgrown trees and greenery that merge with it add a sense of approachability, rendering the environment warm and inviting. The sunlight that floods in from the mountainous background creates an iridescent gleam across the water, whilst the circular lanterns illuminate the heart of the building and boat, creating a peaceful glow from within. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63a4593290156072102eeb16_miss%202%20jpeg.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://www.niftygateway.com/marketplace/collection/0x8cf0f54ea38b353316722eaf0607e168c5c59129/1"" > Miss </a> , by Bern Kaan Kaya.""That moment when our souls fly freely in a space is when we create our truest selves.""  </figcaption></figure> With ivy ascending the walls and enveloping the roof, bring viewers to a dreamlike state at the synthesis of nature and architected perfection is a common trope for Berk. Soon after he started to create digital art, Berk then began exploring the world of web3 and NFTs.""Web3 has had an influential and positive impact on my artistic career,"" he states.""And the encouraging NFT community has motivated me to grow as an artist. The best thing about web3 is that it allows artists to create freely and be ourselves.""  Motivated by creating unique, detailed stories through compositions of various structural elements, colours, and materials, Berk creates vivid and dreamlike works of art. In doing so, the viewer can step into Berk's world and explore his art as they see fit; to imagine what they would do and be within the space, to create a world of their own.""It makes me happy to activate people's emotions through my art,"" Berk says.   His landscapes are a language of emotions: a pathway to our truest selves. In Berk's words,""It's all about the clarity of the space."" <br>  ",1785
How web3 has given Netflix and Nickelodeon animator Brandon Mighty a renewed fearlessness,brandon,Mon Aug 22 2022 12:53:53,"Humbled by the pioneering community of artists and collectors in web3, Brandon Mighty has been inspired to pursue unadulterated creativity in NFTs, even story ideas that might be""too strange"". Georgie Miller sits down with the animator and illustrator to discuss what it means to further his professional art career from a new, experimental perspective.",Mon Aug 22 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Animation; Digital-Art; Nouns,Georgie," For Brandon Scott, paramount to his digital art is the element of storytelling. As a career animator for the likes of Netflix, Nickelodeon, and Warner Bros, he layers a broad sense of emotion and deliberate meaning within his work. ""Story is above everything, really. I want every piece I make to feel like a moment in a much larger narrative. Like a small window into an alternate universe,"" says Brandon, who illustrates picture books""by night"" for the likes of HarperCollins and Scholastic.  A graduate of art school specialising in animation, Brandon has been a digital creator his entire life, creating soulful worlds of wonder. After honing his expertise and wielding his toolbox of digital techniques across a range of tier-one studios, including working on the animation for  Charlotte's Web  and creating his own Emmy-nominated series, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Time_(TV_series)"" > Justin Time </a>, Brandon chose to write the next chapter of his own story in NFTs.  After discovering web3 from one of the many Twitter thread frenzies bashing the nascent space, Brandon embarked upon a rabbit hole of research, only to discover a plethora of incredible work and a vibrant collector market. He describes being humbled by the trailblazing nature of the space and was encouraged to venture beyond his traditional professional credentials. ""I can try new things with digital art in a fearless way because there are no real consequences to mistakes, and I find those mistakes sometimes lead to new ideas and breakthroughs in your work,"" says Brandon of his affinity with the digital ecosystem. And with this same fearlessness, Brandon has entered the world of NFTs, buoyed by the spirit of exploration and experimentation to sate even his wildest creative impulses.  ""I've gained a bit of confidence that some of my weirder ideas might have a home, given the wide diversity in digital art I see being made in web3,"" he says.""I've taken small, bite-sized things I might have thought too strange to pursue in animation or books, and been able to put it out there as its own small thing or collection. I look at web3 as an artist as a new frontier to try out new things, not repeat work I've already done in other fields. I want to put out some of the really weird ideas I have and invite others to join me and collect if they enjoy them.""   ""I had an idea to do a traditional gallery, with large canvas paintings of balls of different things, but it never went anywhere.""    Brandon Mighty   Brandon's pioneering experiment in web3 began with<a href=""https://foundation.app/collection/foundation?creator=0x66Df0A3C697F25134a73fd3030F2c3A9a6861BBC&sortOrder=DEFAULT"" >  Balls </a>, his first full collection.

The original idea for Balls started years before I minted them as NFTs. I had an idea to do a traditional gallery art show, with large canvas paintings of balls of different things, but it never went anywhere. Once NFTs came into the picture, it seemed like a great way to start my journey by opening up that idea from the vault,"" says Brandon.  This kind of experimentation outside the traditional art space has given artists a fresh breath of motivation to explore their creativity within web3. Brandon speaks of how he found confidence in his own unique style to set him apart from others already in the space. His lively and light cartoons all have a fun volume of quirkiness and sentiment in every frame.  Beyond his professional training in animation, Brandon draws from the grandiosity of Baroque artists, the expressive brushstrokes of impressionists, and the ethereal nature of surrealist works. Along with all this merge of styles, Brandon's work has an all-encompassing newness that underlies a great sense of openness and excitement.

I don't make serious art very well¶ I've tried, and it just doesn't work!

That said, the collection of which he is most proud is <a href=""https://objkt.com/profile/brandonmighty/created"" > Dark Places </a>. Brandon explains that the main idea was to tie the work together based on a feeling rather than a subject, with that feeling being a gentle dose of unease. ""I wanted this project to be a celebration of the spooky feelings one felt when reading a truly spooky book as a child. They're whimsical and funny and innocent, but also slightly unnerving and, hopefully, they stay with you."" Brandon credits  Dark Places  for bringing him a wave of attention in the space; some of the pieces have been <a href=""https://twitter.com/misanharriman/status/1560570020517728257"" >picked up</a> by the Tezos Permanent Art Collection.  A common element for the subjects in  Dark Places,  and many of Brandon's other works, are blinking eyes. The theme of eyes threaded through his creations juxtaposes a sense of friendliness with mystery for all of his subjects: friendliness because they bring the artwork a sense of humanity, and mystery because it always takes you by surprise. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1024px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1024px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/630378feb1d595a3c391fd4c_artifact%20(1).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1A6BUrTYkX5kGzvJhRCKoT3ACb5npMjYvK/20""> A Dark Place 21 </a> , by Brandon Mighty. </figcaption></figure> In line with this experimental spirit, Brandon is finding new heights to scale.

Iranian-born enigmatic artist C3 answers 'yes' to the question. Known as C, the anonymous artist is a man with a kind heart and a clear mission. He describes himself as political, his work is anti-regime, and his mission is to share what is happening in Iran, a country he describes""as the end of the world.""  Crypto, anti-regime art, and OpenSea are all banned in Iran, but thanks to NFTs, his work is found worldwide in the hands of loyal collectors. Twelve months ago, he had a regular job, and today he's a successful full-time NFT artist. His ability to ""keep going"" and his stubbornness to continue ""showing up"" brought him eventual success.   However, his journey was arduous, full of darkness and suicidal thoughts.   C discovered NFTs through crypto artist XCopy. While watching the BBC, an XCopy 1/1 piece appeared on the screen, and he instantly recognised the talent behind the art and became curious about the technology behind it.""I didn't know that there was actual art on NFTs. I always thought it was PFP collections. But then I saw that painting and thought, wow, that's actually an impressive painting, I should check out NFTs.""  The stakes are real, yet he continues to make anti-regime street graffiti at night.   Curiosity led him down the NFT path, which took him to quit his job three months ago. However, the choice to exclusively make art comes at a cost. In Iran, his freedom and security are at risk, and he goes to great lengths to mask his identity and retain anonymity. The consequences for producing his art are torture, prison, or death  "" a risk he is willing to take. Four months ago, he stopped shipping physical canvases because customs authorities asked too many questions. The stakes are real, yet he continues to make anti-regime street graffiti at night.   His mission outweighs the risks of being caught. Most of his paintings have a true story behind them, connected to events, experiences, and memories. These stories are the ones he depicts through his art.""In 2018, around 5,000 people were killed on the streets of Tehran. And no one in the world cared or knew about these things. Imagine if 5,000 people were killed in the UK, in a month, on the streets.

The ones of mothers, fathers, and children being killed on the streets, protesting for freedom or food. Using NFTs, he shares these stories with his collectors, who in turn share them with people on Twitter and Discord across the globe. His art delivers a specific message to collectors, beyond aesthetics and above the noise of mainstream news, symbolising a cohesive body of work.  On Zoom, with the camera off, he describes himself as stubborn and hot-headed. When he speaks, you hear he's serious, but at the same time, he cheerfully laughs at his ignorance when starting out.""I had 0.2 eth in my life. I went to mint, but I didn't know about gas fees, and it was the height of the bull run when Eth was over $4,000; back then, gas fees were insane. I clicked, but something went wrong, it kept reducing my eth, and I was like, 'what is happening? Why is it going down?' I eventually figured it out.""  Like other artists, he made mistakes, and often believed he would never sell any of his work. Personal matters caused him depression to the point where every day, from the moment he woke up until the moment he went to sleep, he contemplated suicide. A self-described introvert who counts very few people as genuine, real-life friends, he lacked a network to lean on, and so he turned to the people he knew online. DMs from the community asking, 'are you okay?', 'what can I do?'  "" these acts of kindness kept him going in the early days.   ""Maybe if it wasn't happening for me, I could help other artists to have motivation with some sales.""    C3   Struggling to find sales and fearing he wouldn't make it, he thought about other artists in the same position as him.""During those months, I didn't have any sales. I didn't have any money; maybe $800 was all I had back then. I thought maybe I could help other artists by giving them a sale. I saw a good piece from Smile Ghost and bought it. I ended up spending one-third of all the money that I had in my life collecting pieces from artists to give them a boost, because maybe if it wasn't happening for me, I could help other artists to have motivation with some sales."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ae507f19119644e80ea454_The%20Rebel..gif"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" > <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1FAFcztDjgKZfDqXLDU8NSmYor9rjnfET2/4""> The Rebel. </a> , by C3. </figcaption></figure> C embodies empathy.

In Tezos in particular, he sees a fantastic community and""a great place to start a journey,"" with artists who are""genuine kind human beings.""  As an artist, C3 claims that he is lucky. After five months with no sales, his first collector, mr703, bought two of his genesis Dystopian pieces. He doesn't know why or how mr703 found his work, but he is forever grateful to him and his collectors for believing in his idea.""I always try to take care of my collectors and do things for them.

""New people should know that making random art that is not connected is not the way. You have to know what you want to say and build around it. Many people go for only aesthetics or random things that they see. I'm sure they are beautiful, but when you buy Van Gogh, he had a style and something to say. Maybe he had 200 paintings, but it was the same idea across different paintings. It's part of a bigger message that a painter or an artist wants to say, and you get a piece of that idea by getting one painting from a collection. And it means more to people when they know that it's a body of artwork, not just a single piece. XCopy is not a single piece. You can spot XCopy from 2015 until now. Certain people are drawn to that. I think it's important for newer people to know that they should figure that out and keep pushing that.""  From his studies, he was inspired by many artists, especially propaganda posters from World War II. He describes his work as""minimalistic,"" where less is more. He conveys a clear concept, relying on black, white, red, and sometimes yellow. These colors are his tools, an instrument to visualise powerful ideas repeated over a series of works.   It is easy to see that he is an artist with a clear mission, which he works to fulfil every day with a complete body of work stored on-chain. To C, blockchain represents a revolution for preserving history, a record of stories that cannot be erased.""Russia invading Ukraine was the end of the world one day, and no one is talking about it the next week. They are bombing Ukraine right now, but that story is being erased in front of our eyes. But you can preserve that story or timeline, and hope that people find it now or ten years from now, and that for me is amazing.""   ""I don't want to think 'back in the day I could have done NFTs, and for some reason, I didn't'.""    C3   After a tumultuous year filled with ups and downs, does he have any advice for new artists coming into this space?  ""Be stubborn. It's impressive when people know someone is showing up for a year. Figure out what you want to say and stick with that and stand for that, fight for it, for whatever you want to say. Make friends, have sympathy, and care about people. Cheer for other people's success. It has good karma.""  C has hit his stride as a full-time NFT artist in the past three months. A plethora of talented people inspire him; some renowned, some lesser-known, but all embodying the kindness and community found on Tez, including <a href="""" >@Abs0lutelywrong</a>, <a href=""http://twitter.com/VSTRVL_FFF"">@VSTRVL_FFF</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/cemhah"">@cemhah</a>, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/SmileGhostNFT"">@SmileGhostNFT</a>.  And he is someone who does not want to live with regret.""Ten, twenty years from now, I don't want to think 'back in the day I could have done NFTs, and for some reason, I didn't'."" By showing up daily and conveying a singular idea, he found his voice and a community of friends, artists, and loyal collectors. ""Making friends and real connections is the most important part of the NFT journey. The art itself is important but finding people who think like you is way more important than the actual art.""

Producer, writer, and director of Flinch, Cameron Van Hoy, is innovating the film-making process. His platform will give filmmakers and audiences alike the tools to build their own, unique stories. Mark Fielding asks, is Flinch the prototype for the democratisation of film-making?",Mon Jan 09 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Film,Nft-Film-Squad; Metaverse; North-America; Usa,Mark Fielding," Show, don't tell. Transmit the experience, not the information. The preeminent tool in the screenwriter's arsenal. But what if  you  are the experience? What if  you  are the character? How do you show a character's flaws and idiosyncrasies then? How do you unveil a plot if the film is experienced' in the metaverse, and the audience  is  the deus ex machina?  It is early morning in California. Cameron Van Hoy, producer, writer, and director of film3 franchise,  Flinch , has woken up early to compensate for the nine-hour time difference between us. Cameron is one of a handful of directors leading the film3 vanguard, but he is no stranger to Hollywood. As a child actor, he starred alongside Burt Reynolds and Mischa Barton in the 1999 film  Pups , soon after he appeared on  Hey Arnold  and  Crash . In 2010 he wrote and produced  Tooken  and  Sharkproof , before producing comedy horror,  Tragedy Girls .  Flinch  is his feature-length directorial debut and is receiving critical acclaim, not just in web3, but across the wider film industry.   Despite the early morning wake up call, Cameron is laden with enthusiasm. As he talks, he gives the impression that he would stay awake for days on end to speak about cinema, making movies, and the web3 future that he feels will become our present sooner rather than later.""When I learnt about the blockchain,"" he says,""I realised that this is going to change film."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2016px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2016px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63bc534ad4c3848872228bde_yfsZQit.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Cameron Van Hoy, writer, director, and producer of  Flinch .""This is going to be a new thing."" </figcaption></figure> He is not referring to distribution and licensing and NFT funding  although that is part of it , he is referring to NFT communities and the virtual film studio that he is building. Yes, Cameron's ambition for film is nestled in a loftier place than most. When finished, the Flinch ecosystem will give filmmakers, storytellers, and, perhaps more crucially, audiences an alternative route to get stories made. In many respects, Flinch is the prototype for the democratisation of filmmaking.  ""The system still works,"" Cameron says, weaving a narrative that leaves room for the existing structure to run in concert.""Hollywood isn't dying by any means. This is going to be a  new  thing."" He accentuates the word new', adamant that former boundaries no longer define what is and is not cinema, what is and is not filmmaking. If the technology delivers on its promises, then there is space for this new thing' that Cameron speaks of. I imagine a Venn diagram of cinema, Hollywood, film3, the metaverse, and NFTs, the movie experience holding court in the centre.   ""This is going to change film.""     Cameron Van Hoy   Streaming platforms and the 'Golden Era' of television are responsible for some of the best entertainment since the creation of the cathode-ray tube. But the gift of such wonderful storytelling came with a cost: middlemen. With the dilution of quality and an audience increasingly aware of the constraints placed upon their viewing choice, might their hold be weakening? Cameron is as excited as anyone to see the advent of change.""Middlemen are getting cut out and I'm interested in seeing how it works in film. If you crack that code there is a big prize on the other side.""  What needs to be deciphered to crack that code? Where do you start?""What if the Flinch NFTS are characters in a franchise?"" Cameron muses.""What if the community owns and builds the franchise? How powerful could that be?"" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1280px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1280px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63bc551e3ec96d32a2b0b543_flinch.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >Flinch  is a film noir, which tells the story of a hitman falling in love with a woman who sees him commit murder.  </figcaption></figure> Cameron seems to do a lot of his thinking in questions. Curiosity outshone only by his creativity. But then, like a plot twist, the questioning stops and the certainty takes over.""I have to do this,"" he says.""It's the future. And that's where I want to be; good things happen when you are pushing the boundaries.""  Curiously, he brings up the exclusivity of blockchain, defying the common crypto storyline. Is web3 not about universality, about tearing down the barriers of exclusion and opening the world up to everyone? I ask him what he means.""The tech makes it exclusive,"" he explains.""Wallets, gas, onchain, offchain. There are lots of people who aren't going to learn about that. It's a barrier.""  He is right. But with that exclusivity comes passionate and dedicated people: not just filmmakers forced out of the frame for a further superhero reboot, but fans, too. The more Cameron speaks, the more evident it becomes that he is truly passionate about building for them, and about using web3 to create something extraordinary for his community.""People socialise online more than in real life. They go to work, then they get home and go online. I'm just trying to entertain those people.""  For clarity, there is  Flinch , the film, and Flinch, the community and virtual film studio. The film is a crime caper about a hitman falling in love with a woman who sees him commit murder. It is a gritty love story steeped in greed, deception, violence, and desire: a true film noir. However, it was funded the old-fashioned way, with black and white private equity.  Though Flinch is available to watch on Amazon Prime and iTunes, it is the Flinch virtual film studio that really deserves interest. James Cameron used a virtual camera for  Avatar, The Way of Water , a film that cost around half a billion dollars to make and which he says it will need to make <a href=""https://variety.com/2023/film/news/avatar-box-office-james-cameron-2-billion-1235479666/"" >$2 billion</a> to break even. Those are scary numbers, but that is exactly why the Flinch virtual studio is so interesting. It could take the technology that only one filmmaker in the history of the world has had access to, and put it in the hands of a recently graduated film student, an independent filmmaker, or a community of NFTs holders, or you.  To understand how we got here, we first need to rewind to two years ago. Flinch introduced NFTs after the first film had been made as a way to build the community, fund the second film, and create the first film3 movie franchise.    ""What if the community owns and builds the franchise?""    Cameron Van Hoy   With the Flinch IP divided between just over two thousands owners, the Flinch ecosystem was primed to scale up. A second film was planned to build on the core story, then a third. Meanwhile, the community would build the ecosystem themselves and create their own offshoots and separate storylines.""People can build IP around their characters,"" Cameron says. It would be a communal exploration of storytelling where fans own the characters and drive the story themselves.  And that is how the Flinch franchise would have continued, were it not for the summer of 2021.""I was always interested in game engines like Epic Games' Unreal Engine and knew that they would play a role,"" he says, but it was only over that summer when he learnt about them in-depth that he realised how significant the opportunity would be.""I saw an opportunity to create a virtual movie studio, which we could also use as a film set: city streets, a prison, a police precinct, a cinema, with the characters made in 3D to exist in this world."" Flinch evolved from a film franchise into a decentralised movie studio. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:881px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""881px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63c5bcbcf9e9f4d67c7ae9cf_bank.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Part of a film set in the Flinch metaverse. This is where the bank robberies take place. </figcaption></figure> There are 5,555 NFTs, each an individual character, each a potential character in a story. How do you organise thousands of stories? How does the community decide what gets made? Cameron does not have a certain answer.""How to organise thousands of people who own characters in creating their own stories is brand new. I'm learning as I go, trying things"", he confesses. For now, holders will write stories in a Flinch app and the community will vote, possibly with a governance token, on what gets made and when.   ""Anyone can own and build and create. We're giving you the tools.""    Cameron Van Hoy   Simple in theory, complicated in practice. One of the larger concerns about community-led film projects is the lack of quality amongst the population. Storytelling is an art, and it is not disrespectful to say that not everyone is a screenwriter.""If you're not a writer,"" Cameron explains, deflecting my question with impeccable ease  he no doubt asked himself this question weeks, if not months ago ,""you can use AI to fill out the script: an AI taught through the Flinch universe."" Is it too grandiose to say that Flinch could, with the use of AI, bring writing to the non-writers, and with Unreal, bring visual excellence to everyone? ""Jenny robs a bank,"" Cameron says, giving an example of an infinite number of stories that could be filmed in Flinch.""The holder could voice the character, use AI to do the voice, or even licence the IP to somebody else.""  With Flinch, Cameron Van Hoy is building an ecosystem for people to make films and incredibly good content.""Anyone can own and build and create. Whether you're coming out of movie school or you have two hundred films under your belt, we're giving you the tools. That is the democratisation of it."" ",2908
Can web3 change film financing?,can web3 change film financing,Tue Jan 10 2023 10:52:24,"Traditional methods of film-funding Lea Rose Emeryve much to be desired. With it being almost impossible for proposals to gain backing from big, studio executives, filmmakers are often relegated to low-value crowdfunding. Web3 is providing an alternative solution. Dominique Roy discusses Hollywood gatekeeping, and how web3 is making the filmmaking industry more accessible.",Tue Jan 10 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Film,Daos; Tokens; Web3-Funding-Models,Dominique," Film has the power to move us, change the way we see the world, or start a conversation that might not have taken place. But long before audiences partake in the community experience of watching a film, the dog and pony show for film financing begins. The journey to creating the next Hollywood blockbuster or film-festival indie darling starts with the dollar.  Unfortunately, there is no hard and fast rule on securing funds to make a movie. From studio financing to private investors, the traditional routes of funding films can not only be difficult, but can delay development for years, forcing talented directors or actors to drop out of projects. Tired of waiting for permission, web3 enthusiasts have taken it upon themselves to fix the financing issue that has continuously plagued the industry. From tokens to voting platforms, web3 is offering a solution to level the playing field and create funds for emerging talent.  Historically, film financing has relied heavily on gatekeeping. Studios have the necessary backing, but gaining access to those who control the funds is no easy task. Directors, producers, and screenwriters require connections to the right people or an already-established career in order to get in front of the executives who hold the purse strings. That is not without reason, however: investing hundreds of millions of dollars is, evidently, a substantial risk that is not handed out to anyone lightly, let alone in unknown quantities. But it relegates up-and-coming filmmakers to applying for soft funds', such as government grants or raising money through friends and family. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63bd57c0dd0f6e442799f497_DCP.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Decentralized Pictures is a non-profit organisation with a mission to""create a setting where artistic collaboration can flourish"". </figcaption></figure> Although a more approachable avenue than pitching to studios, grants can often feel like a tremendous amount of work with little return. In many cases, grant programmes receive thousands of applications and are only able to fund a handful of projects. These endowments can range from anywhere between a few hundred dollars to a few hundred thousand, but this pales in comparison to the funds distributed by professional studios. In North America, for example, the average feature film costs $50 million to make. Funds received from friends and family stand no chance of making up the difference. This consequentially forces emerging filmmakers to tell their stories on a substantially lower budget than a standard Hollywood picture.  Initially, crowdfunding seemed to be the answer to a more egalitarian approach to financing. However, in the current sea of campaigns, film projects can get lost amongst the bids for honeymoon funds and startup concepts. Platforms like <a href=""https://seedandspark.com/"" >Seed&amp;Spark</a> provide a designated space for raising money for films, but leave the heavy lifting of marketing and promotion in the hands of the producers themselves. Facing hurdle after hurdle, it is only natural that filmmakers would grow tired of the conventional approaches to funding their movies. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1630px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1630px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63bd5a0b0620076f0c84d654_Director%27s%20chair.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://rarible.com/token/tezos/KT1Su3fNrnABFSYMtWVDZnMbH3DzJeysAd6t:2768?tab=overview"" > Directors Chair - 4 of Hearts - Deck 50 - #2768 </a> , part of Decentralized Pictures' FILMCREW NFT collection. </figcaption></figure> Web3 is one logical evolution of standard crowdfunding platforms. Through the use of token rewards systems, organisations in web3 can offer more than the traditional incentives found in crowdfunding campaigns: they can offer reciprocity for time and interest. Backed by industry heavyweights, <a href=""https://decentralized.pictures/"" >Decentralized Pictures</a> (DCP) is shifting the power of fundraising into the hands of the audience and filmmakers themselves. Based on a DAO structure, in which members vote to dispense community funds, DCP has moved away from top-down funding to a more accessible system. Decentralized Pictures aims to""create a setting where artistic collaboration can flourish"".  Organisations in web3 can offer more than the traditional incentives found in crowdfunding campaigns.  Through token-based financing, DCP plans to make project funding more even-handed. Users buy their initial batch of tokens, which they earn by participating in decisions, and can vote on which projects should receive financing. This has allowed the non-profit to reach filmmakers of all levels, not just established directors and writers, through a democracy that is open to creators and film enthusiasts alike. Although still in the early stages, DCP has identified a future system that could greenlight pictures that may have otherwise not been made.  There are a myriad of ways that web3 could improve film financing, but they are up against decades-old systems that are resistant to change. Film is experiencing radical shifts, not only in the movement away from cinemas to streaming platforms, but, with artificial intelligence, the even more fundamental question of how a film is actually made. Adaptation of web3 funding models may take time but, for those willing to open their minds to the possibilities, they might see a system that moves more quickly, shares resources, and, ultimately, creates better art.

"""It felt like me""  How Champ Medici is forging his own path and brand as a driving force in web3",champ medici,Thu Jul 28 2022 20:11:30,"""So we can all touch the world."" Champ Medici felt web3 in his soul enough to drop a promising sports career. Now an influential collector, community builder, and investor, he's driven to build a legacy in web3 that inspires everyone to touch the world. Interviewed by skidrowcrypto in Los Angeles, Li©a Emery writes the story.",Thu Jul 28 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Communities-built,Medici; Collectors; Investors,Lea Rose Emery," In 2018, Cordell Broadus was at a crossroads. After turning his back on a potentially lucrative career in the NFL, the man better known in web3 as Champ Medici, Snoop Dogg's son, cleared a route of his own  finding the crossroads of technology, real estate, and entrepreneurship. He found a place to fully integrate his interdisciplinary passions on the blockchain, äwhere fashion, film, and music""cross-pollinate at the highest level.""  For Champ, web3 is a place where an ethos around access and opportunity converges with his artistic and entrepreneurial passions. In fact, seeing how traditional banks could perpetuate prejudice helped him realise the power of web3 to equalise opportunity.""Sometimes when my mom wants to pull out some money, everything is suspicious,"" he explains. ""She's a Black woman. All the things that come with that, like 'why do you want this large amount of money?'... They didn't really want to help me. I felt like I couldn't do anything. Seeing how this side (crypto) works, everything is in your control. You don't have to wait. They're not closed on Sundays. They don't have attitudes when you ask questions.""    ""I was talking to myself (about web3) for two years, until NFTs became famous. Now I'm a genius? I just did the research.""    Champ Medici on web3 before and after the bull-run   A keen learner with a curious mind, his journey into crypto started with research.""I did a little bit here, a little bit there, and got more familiar with it, because I started to notice it's just like the stock market. I didn't know about the stock market, but that same year I was learning about it. So when I was introduced to cryptocurrency by Nipsey a year later, it was like, oh, this is stocks'ä  "" but it's much faster. It's decentralised. It's on the blockchain. It's the future of digital currency.""  His understanding of the space has helped him become one of its biggest advocates  and architects. Despite beginning to break through in his sports career with UCLA, he was determined to find his own way and quit American football in <a href=""https://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/08/snoop-dogg-son-cordell-broadus-leaves-ucla-football"">2016</a>. Instead, he explains that he wanted to pursue a career that""felt like me."" And the former four-star recruit found a natural home in web3, first as a student, and then an onboarder and navigator for his friends and family. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62e2e3ec4749af528739aab7_XqC9hAg_zp9L2q0m9havhyloLNvTO6YgbJjt1ox3sKuJ33twp1GbrWjrC3CWu6_j4mOu1clcADc-k9pmZWNHIe-IObsWZrfDnQ8OeRpCxwN0GJ_WeH_Z0GeNPvZXkDNyPuyDQkh-D9CaTWJRpe8WDTk.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption >  ""Me being Snoop Dogg's son is going to get me in the room, but who I am is going to keep me in the room."" Champ Medici, photographed by @skidrowcrypto. </figcaption></figure>  ""When all that started to become more mainstream, everybody was like, Go talk to Cordellä; he's been telling us about it for years',"" he says, adding""I was talking to myself (about web3) for two years, until NFTs became famous. Now I'm a genius? I just did the research. It's all on YouTube. It's all in front of you. You can go read these articles. You can go on <a href=""https://ethereum.org/"">Ethereum.org</a> and figure out what all that means. I'm a student first, so it was always fun for me to learn new knowledge.""  The discovery and self-education required to succeed in web3 was an energising opportunity for a man who was never comfortable in the structured, teacher-led classroom setting.""I didn't really like learning schoolwork, but I was always into finance, tech, film, fashion. I was always learning.""   ""You have to see what it is before it becomes what it's going to be.""    Champ Medici on getting into web3   Aware of his position as the son of his famous father, it's clear he's willing to work hard to stand on his own merits and earn his place at the table.""I'm here to get to the next level. The next door. This right here is a key to get to the next room, because me being Snoop Dogg's son is going to get me in the room, but who I am is going to keep me in the room.""   Champ has certainly led his own path in the space, beyond deserving credit for bringing Snoop into the space. He's also helped build their partnership with <a href=""https://twitter.com/claymates/status/1509583935059202050?lang=en"">Clay Mates</a> on Cardano as well as helping the likes of Jeff Bezos and Tommy Hilfiger engage in crypto. His pitch? ""I tell everybody it's your own risk if you're going to jump into it, but it's also a risk if you don't. Look at Disney when they started in the '50s and they first went public. How many people didn't invest that wish they did later down the line, because now there's amusement parks and movies. Now it's all that. But you have to see what it is before it becomes what it's going to be.""  Yet he's also inspired by the blossoming entrepreneurship, grit, and recognition of fellow creatives creating their own path for themselves and their communities. It's something that he recognises from the early days of hip-hop.""The reason why I say (NFTs) feel like hip-hop is because every time I'm at these conferences, or I'm at these NFT weeks, whenever I'm on the streets, people come up to me like it's a mixtape,"" he explains. ""Look at my NFT. This is what I do. My name is this, I go by this'"" and I'm like, Yo, this is rap shit. You're coming up to me with your rap name, you're coming up to me with your product, your style is on point.' I wasn't even born until '97 so I don't know what hip-hop was like when it first started.   ""I didn't really like learning schoolwork, but I was always into finance, tech, film, fashion. I was always learning.""    Champ Medici on schoolwork versus learning   ""But when I look at the footage, and I see people in New York, see Biggie on the corner freestyling, and my dad in Long Beach freestyling with Nate Dogg and Warren G, I'm like Yo this is the same shit we're doing with NFTs'. I'm linking up with artists, graphic designers, and creative people to come up with a concept that can keep people entertained and engaged. That's the same as making music.""  And it's that boundless passion for creativity, for recognising and rewarding talent, that makes web3 such an ideal fit for Champ. He sees its potential as a space for everyone, and, perhaps more importantly, is willing to help people get there, from friends and family to other enthusiasts and adopters. ""Whenever I'm at conferences, I'm not in the VIP area. I make sure I'm in the crowd, I make sure I'm on the street, and places where you can touch me and ask me questions. Yeah, I'm creative and I have a platform, but it's not really about me, it's about we.""  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2048px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2048px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62e2e8b48da54bec40a39ffd_FWbS9OtXgAAKtZI.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Champ Medici shares a joke with  <a href=""https://twitter.com/thekevinseo""> Kevin Seo </a> , co-founder of Food Fighters Universe, in front of Champ's Bored Taco food truck at ApeFest 2022.

Already a sizable investor in web3, with Yuga Labs, MoonPay, and Sound.xyz amongst the companies in his portfolio, Champ is looking to support""Anybody that I feel is a game-changer."" He is also keen to elevate under-represented leaders in web3.""If I can find a startup, or find a very intuitive innovator  "" a Black woman, an Asian woman, a Black man, or an Asian man  "" then that's where we're going to go with it because I'm tired of being the only Black man in the room.""  It's clear that Champ is ready to elevate innovators and creatives, helping them find a path as meaningful as his. As someone who walked away from neatly wrapped career paths to find his own way, he understands the nourishment that creatives need.""I was like there's gotta be another way', because that doesn't talk to my soul.

In web3, with his continually expanding vision across culture, fashion, and technology, it is clear that Champ has found an arena that talks to his soul.

How Chris Castig is building web3's answer to Discord,chris castig,Fri Oct 28 2022 12:03:43,"Chris Castig has always sought to give other people a voice. An educator before becoming an entrepreneur, his first company taught people to code in 30 days. He speaks with Leo Nasskau about his new mission at Console, giving communities better tools to collaborate by""super-powering the chat"" and using blockchain to disrupt web3's own darling: Discord. Lea Rose Emery Rose Emery tells the story.",Tue Nov 01 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Use-Cases; Identity; Communities; Applications,Lea Rose Emery," ""I think the big tipping point will come when web3 gets more mainstream adoption in the real world. Inclusivity and scaling it: these are the challenges it has right now."" Chris Castig is taking a huge step in that direction. A builder, educator, and entrepreneur, Chris is building Console, a platform based on web3 principles  but not exclusively for web3 natives  that's built to replace Discord. His vision to integrate web3 technology with everyday tools is as impressive as it is broad, with roots that stem back to his own lightbulb moment for the power of decentralisation, as a musician and creator. ""It's funny because right now we talk a lot about decentralization and web3  and music was highly centralised,"" says Chris, who started a music degree before switching to computer science.""You could only basically get it from one place. There were these supreme gatekeepers in music, and overnight this app came out: Napster.""  Napster was a revelation for the music industry and for Chris personally.""It's the first in a line of decentralised file sharing. All of a sudden my mind just shifted, and I could see there were other ways to send information or music.""  With this discovery, he decided to learn to code, which came with a""lot of benefits"" beyond those he already expected. The change happened naturally as he realised how much coding could help facilitate the life he wanted to lead while pursuing music.""At first I thought coding was this thing that happened in computer science classes, it was so serious. But then all of a sudden, I was able to be on tour or playing music anywhere.""   ""Overnight this app came out: Napster.""    Chris Castig   It's clear that this autonomy remains a huge driver for Chris. He describes coding and living on his own schedule as""a way of decentralizing my work,"",and found a freedom that he wanted to give to others. In 2013, he was accepted into Y Combinator, the legendary startup school that incubated businesses like Airbnb, Stripe, and OpenSea. Joining Y Combinator had once been an""impossible mountain"" in his mind, but they liked his approach and his vision to make coding accessible to everyone. ""I was an admirer of Paul Graham's blog (co-founder of Y Combinator). Then we applied  with my friend who then became my co-founder  and got in based on our idea that you could learn to code in 30 days."" It's a time he remembers fondly and enthusiastically, grateful for the doors it opened and the connections he built. It was during this first entrepreneurial journey that he first was introduced to web3 and began to be inspired by innovators in the space. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1202px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1202px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/636036e15a7b4c3db16b7552_chris-4-transformed.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Chris is equal part entrepreneur and educator. He started his first company nine years ago before moving into web3 to participate in a""whole new revolution in the web."" </figcaption></figure> At the time, it wasn't web3  it was the""user-owned"" internet  and Chris was impressed by those leading the charge. He notes people like Juan Bennet at IPFS and Brian Armstrong alongside the founding Coinbase team, describing them as""people who were thinking a few steps ahead"". What stood out to Chris was the idea of a permanent database, the decentralised ledger.""I could see the promise of having what I call a forever database. To me, that's what a blockchain is. It's this database that we have that we can store information on  and trust, because we trust code. We don't have to trust people. I was just like, Wow, you guys are thinking of this whole new revolution in the web'.""  Chris had been teaching about blockchain since 2016, joining Columbia Business School as an adjunct professor in 2017 after developing his skills as a teacher at General Assembly. A fluid communicator, his enthusiasm is infectious. Making clear his belief in a""multi-chain"" future, he stresses that he's""not in any one camp"", though his passion for the simplicity of Bitcoin, the original technological breakthrough, is clear.   ""I think [Bitcoin's] slowness, its rate of change  that's its superpower. ""    Chris Castig   <a href=""http://console.xyz"" target=""_blank"">Console </a>works on Bitcoin and Ethereum, and he is equally excited about building on both blockchains as well as expanding to others, but he speaks about the former with particular admiration, which he sees as an""underdog"" despite its massive presence. ""I think its slowness, its rate of change  that's its superpower, "" he says.""Every day Bitcoin continues to exist, it gets stronger because no one's hacked it. It gets stronger because we put more money into it. We trust it more; we do transactions. Then the layers come in: Lightning and Stacks specifically allow you to harness that power of the underlying Bitcoin  of Bitcoin as a forever database.""  He sees a similar phenomenon happening in the Ethereum ecosystem, which has its own Layer 2 scaling solutions like <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/arbitrum"">Arbitrum</a>, Polygon, and Skale, but points out the differences in the underlying structure.""The two chains are making different bets."" A key difference between the two blockchains is how they treat smart contracts, with Ethereum adding greater complexity into its code to make it easier for developers to build smart contracts on top of it.""Over in the Bitcoin camp, it's a different architecture. They're saying let's not touch that code, because the more you add complexity to it, the more opportunity there is for it to get bloated or to get hacked'."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1456px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1456px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/635bc93b972abeee16b6b5ed_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(1).jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Log in with wallet. Console is deeply integrated with decentralised digital identities to ensure safe, secure, an productive chat communities. </figcaption></figure> Security and simplicity are obvious priorities for Chris  and for Console. The idea of Console is a deceptively straightforward one for how disruptive it could be. He describes it as a web3-native alternative to Discord, but leveraging web3 principles of decentralisation, security, and open source software. When it comes to fruition, it's easy to see how it could shape web3 in the way other deceptively simple innovations shaped web2. ""I love open source software and I really loved what WordPress has done for the world,"" he says.""Literally, 40% of the internet is open source WordPress websites. So it's had a dramatic effect on democratizing publishing, democratizing people having a voice. It's allowed individual people to have blogs.""  What WordPress has done for individuals, Console hopes to do for communities. Right now, Discord is the""biggest club in web3 internet, but if you zoom out, there's a lot more people in the world we could bring into this"". Rather than being an overwhelming space, Chris wants Console to be collaborative, to elevate voices from around the web.""My hope for web3 is that we're able to create these tools that could be used to make real change in the world, whether that's at the city level, whether that's at home, whether that's at the business level.""  Of course, it's easy to talk about the principles of web3, to throw around empty rhetoric without specific goals. Chris is clear on where he  and Console   are heading, and what principles he's using to guide it.""To me, it's three things: it's decentralised, it's ownership of your data and your identity  and it's open source."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1428px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1428px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/635bc7be1cbf0489d7058f77_FgGB0RtWAA83qb9.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Console is premised on the idea the tools we use to communicate online should require us to give up control of our digital identities. </figcaption></figure> Security is inherently a high priority when building decentralised and open-source projects. While Discord is vulnerable to hacks, Console will put identity first, authenticating it onchain and thus making it more secure from malicious actors. Chris believes that this will promote greater awareness of what identity really means, pushing the discourse around how you secure it into a more prominent place in the future. ""Identity is this crucial piece of web3 that I don't think many people appreciate yet,"" he says.""What does that even mean? ... If you go to Instagram and you create your name, you give your email, you get a password. That data is stored over in Instagram's servers, where they own it."" As he points out, any Instagrammer who has been locked out of an account can quickly feel what it's like to lose control of your identity and your platform.  Chris remains characteristically optimistic.""On the bright side, there are a lot of really smart people thinking about decentralised identity. ENS are doing an amazing job with anyone that owns a .eth name. There's also .btc, there's also .sol.""  By leveraging on-chain identities, Console aims to create more comprehensive user profiles without compromising on security.""Think of chat as our core interaction  Console is chat,"" he explains.""How do we use existing data in the world to improve the chat conversations that we're having, to make them more meaningful, to make them more efficient, and coordinate better? ""That's the question we are asking ourselves and there's already a lot of data on the blockchain that people are contributing. So at Console, we're not building our own voting app and we're not building our own treasuries. We're using external projects and we're thinking of them as modules, we're pulling that data in and we're super-powering the chat.""  How this will play out in practice is in ease of use and a full picture of a user's identity. Chris describes the ability to hover over a name and have data at your fingertips.""I could really easily, with open data, build this portfolio of you in my mind. That allows me very quickly to get a sense of who you are, whether to interact with you, or how I might want to."" When identity is onchain, it's much easier to verify if someone is who they say they are. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/635bc9873bda5672db64a73b_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(6).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> </figure> Unlike some innovators  and perhaps naturally entwined with his role as an educator and onboarder  it's apparent that collaboration is a motivator for Chris, rather than the ego that can drive certain corners of the space. He consistently points to forerunners, those he's indebted to, and is open to new ideas and technology while building Console.""We plan on leading it first and then open sourcing it (to involve the community further); there'll be opportunities to get involved and collaborate.""  It may be this collaborative instinct that gives Chris a desire to more fully integrate not just Console, but all areas of web3, with more people's lives. There's a desire to move away from exclusive, alienating jargon and have the technology be something that's simply easy to use.   ""The narrative needs to change.""    Chris Castig   He sees Console as""just a really secure chat app and it happens to use these technologies,"" something that he hopes will not be limited to web3 aficionados.""A lot of web3 people want to just rebuild from the ground up  start everything from scratch. But I think the big moment and the big opportunity is in taking these tools and applying them to existing systems.""  Chris points to fundraising, which will also be an early focus as an area where web3 technologies, leveraging Console, could be incredibly powerful.""I want to see people that bring fundraising to NGOs and to bring it to politics, bring it to the real world. But to do that, the interfaces need to be easier to use, the wallets need to be easier. The narratives need to change."" ",3621

He invested the proceeds to create one of the biggest AI art collections on Tezos. </figcaption></figure> Though CV first bought crypto in 2013, his journey into NFTs only started with NBA Top Shot in December 2020. Having spent the intervening six years away from a space he derided as a Ponzi scheme, he returned as a""PFP trader, investor, flipper, whatever.""  But then, he burnt out. Though the experience had been a great ride, he again found himself wanting more in 2022. Wanting to build something that made  sense.   ""So I decided I was going to start a new wallet just focused on collecting art. I did that, and bought the clown vampire for it, and that was the whole genesis.""  It did not take long for CV to realise that was not enough. After coveting the 24x24 pixel profile for so long, actually owning it felt unsatisfying. He sold it a month later and, since last spring, has been rotating the proceeds into fine art and AI art. Having now collected thousands of pieces, mainly on Tezos, but also Ethereum, it is this massive collection that has given him some""existential satisfaction"".   ""AI has been this massive cultural phenomenon.""    ClownVamp   There is a distinct dichotomy in CV. On the one hand, he is a person who always seems to be wanting more  who found that the clown with vampire hair that he had coveted or his early ride as an investor and trader left him not quite satisfied. On the other hand, he exhibits a visceral, enduring passion for collecting, and for AI art in general. He is someone who has found some existential satisfaction. And that satisfaction is linked, perhaps, to his love for discovering and uplifting emerging artists.  After seeing that""so much of the fun"" with NFTs, including PFPs, came from finding a piece early on and""being part of the journey"", he took the same mindset into collecting AI art.""That really instilled in me my collecting strategy on emerging artists. I don't really collect anything that's expensive,"" he explains.""I basically view myself as: I want to take a lot of risks, I want to collect stuff from people who are stimulating, but I'm also okay if I get priced out of artists and they grow past my ability."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:6656px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""6656px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63fdf84aec3a3ddc75574a71_symbology.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1KSWBouZ8KQ5KUGZPqBc6TKAHDGTSV2LNc/19"" > Symbology </a> , from ClownVamp's own  Detective Jack  collection. </figcaption></figure> For him, collecting is about the breadth. Firstly, he likes that he can positively impact people; the more artists you collect from, the more people you inspire to keep going, and the more artists you raise the profile of. Secondly, he believes that collecting widely means that you will end up having multiple valuable pieces.""30 years from now I can look back and be like, Oh, I was able to build a really meaningful collection of AI art.'"" Even if just five percent of his collection is valuable, emotionally or financially, having so many pieces will make for an important collection, even many decades in the future.  That confidence comes from CV's belief that AI art has only just begun its development into a major category.""I think of it as sort of two large categories. So I call it first wave AI art and second wave AI art."" The first wave  of which ClownVamp cites Gene Kogan and early QuasiMondo as leading examples  stems from generative adversarial networks, one of the most common tools used in the AI art world.  Comprising two neural networks, one is trained on a sample of art, from which it tries to create its own piece; the other tries to identify whether the created piece is part of the training sample or not. The first neural network becomes better and better at fooling the second, while the second becomes increasingly better at detecting fakes.""The result,"" ClownVamp explains,""is that often you have to do a lot of finessing to get images that are coherent and you're painting with a broad brush. They have this aesthetic that people call looking kind of GAN-y.""  If wave one art has""historic value and providence,"" the second wave brings something completely different to the space.""The second wave is the wave that I'm focused on as a collector and also the wave I'm participating in as an artist, which is really the advent of these diffusion models. So that's DALL-E 2, that's Midjourney, that's Stable Diffusion. And with these models you have a) way more aesthetic power and b) a lot more control over the result."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:6144px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""6144px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63fdf7fc3ec1e5698a130dbe_the%20ship.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1GT3C4qBAuqqhAgp4W6mDFKDNsb8WFMA62/38"" > The Ship </a>  from ClownVamp's  The Truth  collection. </figcaption></figure> He uses the word participating' in a literal way. Not only is he an artist and collector, but in this evolving wave the participants are also shaping the narrative. ""That has been this massive cultural phenomenon that is constantly written about because it's so accessible, it's so powerful, it's clearly changing everything. As a collector, I'm focused on that second wave both because I'm a participant in it.""  Artists and collections come thick and fast, from <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/bitairt"" >Deep Black</a>, which he describes as a first wave AI collection, to creators like <a href=""https://twitter.com/i_shkipin?lang=en"" >Ilya Shiplkin</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/richardnadler1?lang=en"" >Richard Nadler</a>. His reverence for the creators  and for the work  is clear.   ""Everyone in the world now has a superpower.""    ClownVamp  ""Wave two, to me, the part that's interesting is this massive unlock that everyone in the world now has a superpower."" It's the accessibility, the freedom, and the affordability that spurs him on  the fact that anyone with an internet connection can join this wave and create something incredible.  If CV is participating in the second wave of AI art, he's not only doing it as a collector. For him, the collector and the creator hat are""interrelated"".""When I see a piece of AI art, I know what goes into it. I can understand if it's something that is intellectually interesting or challenging, whether that's conceptually or technically. And so I think they're really symbiotic.""  His art is focused on exploring timelines and alternate histories.""I really like this idea that we're living in this one version of the universe; that this is a result of billions of people's tiny decisions. And any of those decisions changing could have had massive impacts."" From his first project, <a href=""https://objkt.com/collection/KT1GT3C4qBAuqqhAgp4W6mDFKDNsb8WFMA62"" > The Truth </a>, one of the all-time most successful collections on Tezos, to his more recent choose your own adventure' project, <a href=""https://objkt.com/collection/KT1KSWBouZ8KQ5KUGZPqBc6TKAHDGTSV2LNc"" > Detective Jack </a>, he is exploring the nature of narrative and timelines  and the choose your own adventure' has been so popular that it is now in its second season.  Themes of narrative and truth are particularly interesting, given CV's other upcoming projects, namely, the <a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/e/deep-fake-tickets-536190087987"" >Deep Fake exhibition</a> coming to Los Angeles in March. Put on by MAIF, a global collective of 75 AI-artists, and curated by ClownVamp, who is a member, it will feature both established and emerging artists from the AI field. Although CV says he has moved past the point of sitting collectors down for coffees and holding""interventions"" about why they need to pay attention to AI art, this show looks at constructed realities, perspective, and  in doing so  faces criticisms of AI art head-on.   ""We're living through the biggest revolution in visual media since the camera.""     ClownVamp  ""I think so much of the discussion around AI art and artificial intelligence is really funny, because we talk about it and we apply this label of artificial', apply this label of fake', but so many things in life are fake. Everything from the idea of a luxury brand is just a basic figment of our imagination that we've been conditioned to value. I think about plastic surgery and all the ways our media images are fake; it's funny that we are really trying to label this one particular visual medium as fake' when so much of life is fake and socially constructed.""  The event will take place on March 3rd, and, with CV's passion driving it, it is sure to be quite a show. It is one next step in the constantly unfurling story of AI art  one that CV is just going to keep enjoying every single step of. ""We're living through the biggest revolution in visual media since the camera  and we are talking about it as it's happening. That is really exciting and cool, and so I'm just happy to live in this moment."" ",3079
Skaling the future of NFT transactions,creating the future of nft transactions,Mon Nov 07 2022 14:29:41,"Buying an NFT is expensive, especially when everyone else is buying them at the same time. That's why a range of scaling solutions have sprung up around core blockchains like Ethereum to make transacting on them cheaper, faster, and easier. Antony Rahman profiles SKALE, the scaling solution's Digital Art Grant, and the artists minting on the network.",Mon Nov 07 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Nft; Layer-2s; Skale; Nftrade; Digital-Art,Antony," It often feels like NFTs are on the verge of becoming a household term. Whether it be for <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/aitch"">music</a>, <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/shavonne-wong"">fashion</a>, <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/sutuverse"">gaming</a>, <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/nft-ticketing"">ticketing</a>, or <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/artistry"">art</a>, use cases for the technology are becoming more common, and it is undeniable that they are an incredibly important part of the world's decentralised future in culture, commerce, and beyond.  However, NFTs in their current form are unpalatable for most of the world's creators and commercial actors. Complexity, uncertainty, and volatile gas fees for transactions all contrive to hinder mainstream adoption. In art, this deprives the world of the chance to experience incredible talents; for builders and communities, it restricts adoption of their products and services.  Hence the enormous proliferation of scaling solutions, which are generally built to make blockchains more usable. Notably, Reddit's Community Points programme, used by millions, is built on <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/arbitrum"" >Arbitrum</a>, whilst <a href=""https://polygonscan.com/chart/tx"" >Polygon</a> powers more than double the number of transactions completed daily on the <a href=""https://etherscan.io/chart/tx"" >Ethereum</a> mainnet. Both have very low gas fees, and solutions like <a href=""https://skale.space/"">SKALE</a> are pushing the technological boundary even further by eliminating gas fees all together.  Speaking to Culture3, SKALE co-founder and CEO Jack O'Holleran explains that""especially at times of high onchain traffic, gas fees are the single greatest UX barrier."" Co-founded with Stan Kladko, SKALE is a zero gas fee Ethereum scaling solution governed by its DAO. For web3 to go mainstream, it needs technologies like those behind SKALE. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1152px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1152px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/636938aae5e836b8099231af_5f0dc34925dfe54221d0166d_skale-network-logo.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Similar to  <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/cosmos""> Cosmos </a> , SKALE is a modular network that allows users to create their own Ethereum-compatible blockchain, but with zero gas fees </figcaption></figure> The network has saved users <a href=""https://skale.space/stats"" >$90m in fees</a> to date, is used on web3 platforms like Arweave and Braintrust, and is being rolled out on the NFTrade marketplace to create one of the world's first zero gas fee NFT platforms. O'Holleran adds that""in order to scale to the next billion users, blockchains are going to need to provide solutions that offer zero gas fee transactions.""  SKALE's integration with NFTrade will allow artists to mint and sell their work free of the gas fees usually involved in those processes, creating opportunities for many artists who may have felt restricted by transaction cost to create their first NFT works, alongside also making it easier for everyone else. With much of the uncertainty removed from the minting process for artists and the buying process for collectors, zero gas fee marketplaces are likely to become the norm over the next few years.  Last February, SKALE announced its <a href=""https://skale.space/blog/skale-100million-usd-ecosystem-incentive-program"">$100m ecosystem incentive programme</a>. Initially used to distribute $5m worth of grants to gaming developers, SKALE recently announced a Digital Art Grant programme to celebrate its partnership with the new marketplace. We spoke to three grantees, the application for which has a <a href=""https://form.typeform.com/to/Kh5D26Go"">deadline of Thursday November 17th</a>, to learn about the art they have created with the grant to mint on the platform: Uruguay's Foleee, the Berlin-based Taya Ferdinand, and the Nigerian artist, Four. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63691daa445f9b64a2d7cab1_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(8).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > SKALE's partnership with NFTrade is one of the first to bring zero gas fee transactions to NFTs </figcaption></figure> Foleee is a digital artist and portrait painter who describes himself as a great admirer of traditional art, synthesising historic traditions and styles into the digital medium. This is distinctly visible in his art style, with its uncompromising realism embedding signs of inspiration from some of the great artists of the 17th century.  That said, the Uruguayan's early relationship with art was complicated. Enrolled in an art workshop by his mother in his pre-teens, Foleee's teacher would have the talented artist recreate her pencil portraits while the rest of the workshop would do the usual, simplistic sketches. He understands today that this was because his teacher saw something significant in his work, but he felt discouraged after being separated from his peers at the time.""As a kid, you always want to be part [of the group] and I felt like I was doing something totally different.""  Subsequently, <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/foleee"">Foleee lived through</a> the eternal artistic conflict between his all-consuming passion and his pursuit of a stable career. He convinced himself that drawing was a childish activity, not one he could carry with him as an adult.""I felt like drawing was a kid thing. And so when I stopped being a kid I said, okay, no more drawing for me'."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6368fec835a2aa6f05269a31_tbYBVIttxj9ax8aP6sYWPWM2qnTZu2GEE6-Sgu0i9dIMefd26Mg6oHmc-pL2h6toULS4Z3XcSa5ZkGEfLNrUGfFL_umy6DcJLdPcNgKviw8jUaqCKJjJYPxdG_p3xydayOOHrm7VxRl9dyo5xOc0Ja5ahe-7uDt9jNT171gBtJlCsG0eG3gFgtgC1isNMA.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Gallantry, by  <a href=""https://twitter.com/Foleee1""> Foleee </a></figcaption></figure> Foleee counts Caravaggio as his ultimate inspiration, whilst Raphael, Rembrandt, and John Singer Sargent are amongst the other masters from whose brushstrokes he tries to learn every day. Yet it was only when NFTs exploded onto the artistic scene that Foleee, then an engineer in his early 20s, returned to digital art.   ""I felt like drawing was a kid thing.""    Foleee   His distinctively warm, South American interpretation of this style is on full display in his texturally complex piece  Gallantry . Foleee explains that the inspiration for this work came from his recent reflections on ideas around honour, specifically one's values and one's commitment to community, culture, and self.  When creating  Gallantry , Foleee sought to imbue the piece with the ideals of chivalry in the simplest way possible.""I wanted to symbolise honour and how I feel we all should live an honourable life and stand by our values in order to make [the NFT space] a better place.""  A similar desire inspired Four's SKALE grant artwork. Based in Nigeria, the digital artist known as Four characterises himself as a""conceptual alchemist"", and exhibits a highly diverse approach to art. From digital photography to vivid depictions of African gods, artifacts and culture, he is known for <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/four"">showcasing Nigerian culture</a> in his work, and his artworks are rife with a sense of exploration, always growing and shifting to challenge his creative sensibilities.   ""Eventually, digital art will be recognised.""    Four   He originally discovered NFTs analysing collections and artists on OpenSea. Collectibles were popular, but there was nothing from his home country that caught his attention.""I was intrigued not to find something from Nigerians. I thought about how I could be distinct in this space. As a Nigerian, we like to represent our culture. I wanted to showcase that.""  Four created  Better Place  from a vulnerable perspective, at a time of introspectiveness and deep aching for the state of the world. In the midst of the many ongoing conflicts of the world, particularly in Ukraine, Four sought compassion and peace. His piece is an expression of wanting to be able to meaningfully help those who are suffering but ultimately being unable to do so. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:680px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""680px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6368fec8dcaf939957e452cb_L5ngjK2I7rDEn3cD0iRWRsXeZvvN2yivnmnTH28X15GxmWR1XJ3bvwC3Lw6p6sxzrgJz8kVqzGpzfBvkOmwE_zKoP1so5WN8kBVxFui4r-AdbOGb1sYyETEdw8XhCNkPwgGIELkkv2hp6g4lM299DgbMHHC0y7KnH2mGhdUb5YO_ry3kC4L8DKc9jMueKQ.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Better Place, by  <a href=""https://twitter.com/weare_thefour""> Four </a></figcaption></figure>""The message I sought to pass was simple: Make peace, not war. Going through war is never easy, and this piece is a representation of my yearning to be present in the situation, to lend a helping hand.""  Despite being a recognised artist in web3, Four perceives continued struggles on the horizon for web3 artists.""Unlike painting or photography, the world does not recognise digital art as legitimate art. We have to work really hard to be seen and do something distinct. I do believe it is impossible for humans to remain in one state, so eventually, digital art will be recognised.""  He expects SKALE's grant programme to have a significant impact on digital artists by making their work easier to mint and collect.""I think the SKALE programme is absolutely amazing; to see this kind of innovation at this level is extraordinary.""  Like Four, Taya Ferdinand has experienced firsthand what web3 means for digital artists. Based in Berlin, the visual artist and and illustrator blends realism with surrealism and a postmodern philosophy. Before diving fully into NFTs last May, she worked as a graphic designer.""I never thought about being a full-time digital artist,"" she explains.""Digital art and artists were used as instruments in achieving goals by other companies, like the game industry, or magazines."" <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/taya-ferdinand"">Web3 changed everything</a> about how she perceived what she could do with her talent and her creativity. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6368fec8cbb838c040207a9a_HYuD36U28x6KFq_IA2LBZ6dyEh_BEAFEZMI29KVIQkjhWEj_52ut9bDMPr14czSUZeBUiuv7GC-udbku_OQLNP8YUwE2tWjrvNbMEjRyT-v-ylbjKpd5QAzsGOl7T10oFKhXzDqfFS8i4ET16nKFzKa7f7SAj09XbKbehAgmJDUK5PL5Ki9aLHLXpJ35LQ.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > I Am, by  <a href=""https://twitter.com/tayaferdinand""> Taya Ferdinand </a></figcaption></figure> Her SKALE grant piece, simply titled  I Am , represents all the aspects that best define her work; spiritual, suspenseful, and imbued with a variety of complex emotions.  Taya's influence for  I Am  was a woman she had once met, who she describes as strong, self-sufficient, and comfortable with herself.""I felt connected to her,"" she summarises. More broadly, Taya suggests""maybe I want to be like her, as I have always struggled with self-acceptance and experienced self-doubt."" In a deeper sense,  I Am  is a tribute to the importance of accepting oneself and being confident in your own skin.   ""Before web3, I never thought about being a full-time digital artist.""    Taya Ferdinand   Encouraged by the growing opportunities for creators across the NFT ecosystem, Foleee argues that empowering and supporting artists is critical for web3 culture to achieve its potential.""There's a lot of us [artists] working really hard for our goals, who could use the extra push that a programme like this can give us in order to make it."" ""I think SKALE's grants program is a great opportunity for new and growing artists,"" Taya adds.""It takes a lot of time to grow, and many of us lack the funds to invest in minting and listing. This kind of grant helps alleviate those problems, and lets creativity flourish."" ",3655

If you're an artist trying to connect, that'll grab your attention. It will change how you perceive an audience, your story and what's possible.""Being in Clubhouse rooms and not having a dry eye in the house when I'm performing this poetry live: it touched me in such a profound way, I can't tell you how many times I wept.""  Is that why David Bianchi came to web3? No, but it is why he stayed.""What kept me was the emotional attachment to people's emotional attachment to my work."" He recalls asking himself at the time,""Is this really happening? How is this real?"" But it was real. Very real, a visceral demonstration of what web3 could do for poets, filmmakers, artists and storytellers of all description.

He's an acclaimed actor, filmmaker, artist and poet, with over 100 professional credits in TV and movies. He's produced five feature films, founded his own film production company (whose work has been licensed by Hulu, HBOMax, and Paramount), and is even a member of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. Why would he seek an alternative path? Was it an opportunity to recreate himself in a nascent digital world, free of the constraints of middlemen and Hollywood control?

A few months later, Beeple was to sell an NFT for $69 million. By then we were deep in the pandemic and David had time on his hands to go down the rabbit hole. His exploration led him to Ephimera, an NFT platform for artists to sell their work as single editions.  Ephimera had a 250mb maximum file size. That was monumental for David  file size is a major limitation for creators working with video. It meant he could turn a five-minute short into a 1/1 NFT.

It became the first award-winning spoken word NFT film. 100% of the proceeds were donated to the George Floyd Memorial Foundation.

Metakovin, aka Vignesh Sundaresan, the NFT collector who bought Beeple's  Everydays: the First 5000 Days .

The executive producers acquire scripts, place talent based on sales and foreign projections, set the budget, shoot the project, test the movie, put it out in the ecosystem and say: this is what you're watching.' It doesn't have to be like that anymore.""   ""It's one of the most important events in art history, going back to painting on cave walls.""    David Bianchi   Creatively, film3 is out in the open, in sharp contrast to how the sector has traditional made films.""Hollywood is going to raise an eyebrow, they're going to poke around. They'll be like,""You're going to let people read 70% of your pilot episode before it shoots?"" Oh to be a fly on the wall when that conversation takes place. At first the Hollywood juggernauts will be confused, then intrigued, and then playing catch-up.  By this point, David expects filmmakers will be able to make and own Hollywood-level motion pictures as NFTs. But without Hollywood.""With the community involvement of film3, we are learning from members what they want to see, how they'd like to consume their art, and how much interactivity they would like to have in the process. Then we, as creators, get to offer that.""  What might that film3 offer look like?""Access to the directors, show runner, cast. Maybe you'll be able to go to pre-production table-reads on Zoom. Even real life table-reads. Maybe an NFT will come with a cameo or minor role in an episode or film. I intend to do all of those things and more at Gala.""  A web3 powerhouse seeking to redefine entertainment, Gala has made its presence, and a $5bn war chest, felt across the gaming and music verticals of web3.

David Bianchi   Gala calls it a 'win-win-win economy' that overcomes the obstacles the wider film3 movement aims to solve: new filmmakers being discovered, rewards for those who deserve them, IP ownership, and interoperability. As the space develops, Gala intends for their gaming, music and film platforms to co-exist, each adding to the other. A kind of cross pollination where music, film and gaming come together to create a unified experience.  Excitedly, David promises""we're gonna come up with some real cool stuff, no doubt about it.""

David says it can.""Performances have to be grounded, focused, and tell an honest story  and bring text to life in a palpable way that creates a catharsis between the audience and the performer.""  What it takes to make a film hasn't changed. What's new is that everyone's invited, and you don't need Hollywood's permission, anything is possible.

" ""I want to push the boundaries of what a poem can be""   in conversation with David Jones",david jones,Wed Jan 11 2023 12:54:46,"David Jones is an internationally best-selling author, with over 300k loyal readers on Instagram. Having started his poetic journey on Tumblr, he is well versed in web2. But now, he is writing a new story for himself over on web3. He tells Georgie Miller why he started to create poetry NFTs and how AI is going to""revitalise the literary world.""",Wed Jan 11 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Storytelling,Poetry; Ai; Uk,Georgie," Writing has always been a way of processing the world for David Jones. Drawing from an affinity for writing barely after he was old enough to hold a pencil, the British writer got his professional start by gaining a following on Tumblr with his deeply profound and succinct poetry.  His thoughtful and quick-witted poetry collections captured a large following on the social media platform, which ultimately turned into seven poetry best sellers. His concise prose is packed with layers of expressionist realism that give way to a whimsical representation of the often mundane moments of life. David's poetry beautifully encapsulates complex scenes of love, relationships, and cosmic space, with language weaving together provocative thoughts blending intangible emotion and tangible reality.  After learning of the strong community of those already enamoured with web3, David was attracted to the limitless creative freedom and experimentalism of the space, and decided to mint a set of four original poems in the summer of 2021 to broaden the depth of his work.""This really felt like a natural progression. The NFT space is full of poets and writers pushing the boundaries of what's possible in terms of both style and form. I love these pieces because they enlarge the scope of our collective, imaginative endeavour,"" David says. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1080px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1080px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63bef478c2e43215e76edcc7_Lost%20in%20Spacetime.webp"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >  ""NFTs represent artistic freedom to me""  David Jones </figcaption></figure> The new frontier for uninhibited creative writing was a breath of fresh air from the woes of social media algorithms and traditional publishing models. By contrast, the relationships between text, author, and audience has undergone a substantial change in dynamic since David's entrance into web3. Selling work directly to connectors has given him new opportunities to innovate his craft.""It lets me be super experimental and take chances that I wouldn't be able to elsewhere."" Since finding great success in minting some of his more daring writings, David has paved an even more compelling path for himself, pushing the boundaries of the traditional literary world.   ""I want to push the boundaries of what a poem can be, and web3 allows me to do just that.""     David Jones   Seeking an alternative from the constraints and inauthenticity that comes with social media, David was drawn to the creative spirit of web3, and finally started to make art purely for the sake of the art itself.""Web3 is a place where I can let my imagination run wild and create work that is totally true to me,"" David says.""NFTs represent artistic freedom to me.""  That creative freedom is apparent in his recent work. Web3 has pushed him towards experimentation with both genre and form, exploring abstract and surrealistic styles while adopting a mixed-media approach, incorporating video, animation, illustration, narration, and AI. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:100%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""100%"" data-rt-dimensions=""240:240"" data-page-url=""https://vimeo.com/788372020""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/788372020"" title=""The Burn List, by David Jones""></iframe> </figure> His  Burn List  project embodies a few of those new techniques. Blending animated illustrations alongside his spoken word poetry""felt like a watershed moment,"" he recalls. The poetry in this collection is highly personal to David, and explores the dichotomy and anxiety of creating online: the constant struggle to remain authentic, amidst the need to do what it takes to earn a living.  Web3 has also given David greater tools to synthesise different creative endeavours. One such project was his<a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/629198"" >  Lost in Spacetime </a>   NFT, which he created to complement his book,  Love and Space Dust . In it, he expands on the book's narrative by continuing on his journey through space, featuring assorted poems and short stories that introduce new characters and developments.""I want to push the boundaries of what a poem can be, and web3 allows me to do just that,"" he explains. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:100%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""100%"" data-rt-dimensions=""240:240"" data-page-url=""https://vimeo.com/788367718""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/788367718"" title=""My Night in the Desert, by David Jones""></iframe> </figure> The nurturing of imaginative self-expression that is so present in web3 expands David's creative confidence with each new project. David speaks excitedly of bringing AI into his poetry, and witnessing the interplay between his own words and artificial intelligence.""AI is a whole new art form and it makes me rethink both my use of language and the potential for what a poem can be,"" he explains.""I love these media-rich approaches because they're so broadly encompassing.""  The layers of themes, symbols, and narratives that are present in such media-rich literature give a new world of meaning to words  meaning that lines of text on a page simply cannot provide. His poem <a href=""https://foundation.app/@storydj/storydjpoems/3""> My Night in the Desert </a>   indicates how David might use these new technological opportunities to further communicate the emotion and candour of his poetry.  ç  "" Over time, we will see even more new forms, new genres, and new voices emerging in web3  this is going to revitalise the literary world"", he predicts. The imaginative space built upon blockchain is, therefore, a fitting home for David.""I hope that web3 will foster a new era of experimentation, creativity, and sheer, unapologetic originality,"" he muses. ""That, I believe, will rejuvenate the industry and generate the next wave of classic, history-defining literature."" ",1816
" ""Nothing is actually permanent""  how DEAFBEEF is innovating with entirely self-made tools on-chain",deafbeef,Mon Jun 20 2022 12:51:31,"Known for his generative audiovisual art, produced with nothing but a C compiler and stored entirely onchain, DEAFBEEF is nothing if not innovative. He spoke to Clovis McEvoy about the democratising potential of technology, the value of self-made tools, and his unlikely journey to the world of web3.",Mon Jun 20 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Generative; Canada; North-America,Clovis McEvoy," <a href=""https://deafbeef.com/"">DEAFBEEF</a> has no interest in shortcuts. Using the self-imposed criteria of a blank slate and only the most basic tools, the Canadian-born artist has built a creative practice where much can be made from little, where the process outweighs the product, and where knowledge is acquired and applied in tandem.  ""Some people think I'm a masochist for doing this"", he says with a shrug. Certainly, the challenge of creating art with nothing but self-written code might give some the chills, but few can argue with the results. His back to fundamentals' approach has produced a series of acclaimed audiovisual works that reveal the artistic potential of the blockchain.  Finding creative fodder from minimal input is a skill developed during his early upbringing in rural Ontario.""We lived several miles away from the nearest village,"" he says.""And this was back in a time where you were free from the constant bombardment of information  "" so, my default state was being bored and I had to search out things to maintain my interest. Music was one of those.""  Passion for music, and the struggle to reconcile this with the more technical side of his intellect, is a recurring theme throughout DEAFBEEF's early years. He considered studying music but eventually opted for engineering  "" though he reversed course after becoming immersed in the music of Frank Zappa. Resolving to build a recording studio, he moved to Toronto aged 22, rented a warehouse space that doubled as his apartment, and scraped together enough audio equipment to get started. With a strong independent rock scene in the city at the time, he ultimately recorded hundreds of bands live on the warehouse floor.""It was a wonderful time of creativity and discovery,"" he recalls.  The tough economics of running a recording studio eventually pushed him to move on and retrain in electrical engineering, but even then, DEAFBEEF says he retained the""romantic notion"" of following in the footsteps of pioneering recording engineers, who often designed, built, or at least maintained, their own audio equipment.  ""I wanted to discover this arcane knowledge,"" he says.""To ultimately use it for some type of creative pursuit, whether that would be designing synthesisers or whatever.""  DEAFBEEF continued to take detours over the coming years. He published academic research on computer animation graphics, wrote commercial software, and worked as a blacksmith before eventually arriving at generative art during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.   ""Making one's own tools is more tedious, it's a bit riskier, but ultimately allows a greater chance for some kind of unique expression.""  The impetus for the DEAFBEEF project came first from a feeling of constraint. With young children to care for during lockdown, he says the extreme lack of free time eventually pushed him to mount what he describes as a""small rebellion"" against his lack of agency. Utilising what little time was left at the end of the day, he set himself a challenge: using a minimal toolset, he would learn sound synthesis.""It was another exploratory journey to embark on,"" he explains.""For me, it's just fun to learn. There was no destination in mind.""  Using nothing more than a cheap laptop, a text editor, and a C compiler, he began creating his own toolset for sound creation. As with much of the artists' thinking, this approach balanced aesthetic and practical concerns: on one hand, he wanted to use software that would remain consistent over long periods of time without recourse to updates; on the other, he wanted to avoid pre-made tools that might force him into a particular way of working. ""I want to maintain an intimate relationship with the underlying medium,"" he says.""Every tool leaves a kind of imprint. Making one's own tools is more tedious, it's a bit riskier, but ultimately allows a greater chance for some kind of unique expression."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:604px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""604px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62b06c486f42fc1ac094d8d0_Section%2005%2C%20Advection%2C%20by%20DeafBeef.png"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" > <figcaption ><a href=""https://www.deafbeef.com/series/5""> Series 5 - Advection </a> , by DEAFBEEF </figcaption></figure> The outputs of DEAFBEEF are best described as works of generative visual music. Equal aesthetic weight is given to both the audible and visible aspects of the work, and there is usually an underlying mechanism in his code that directly links the sound and animation. Rather than plan each individual element of the work, as a traditional composer or painter might, DEAFBEEF's approach is to set the initial conditions of a system and then seed it with a random element. Through an iterative process of trial and error, a system emerges that generates moments of striking beauty that even its creator couldn't fully anticipate.  ""Experimentation is what's rewarding about it,"" he explains.""You might have a vague goal  "" but somewhere along the way you'll find something interesting, you'll take that path, and you'll end up somewhere completely different.""  DEAFBEEF's interest in generative systems dates back to his youth, when he'd spend hours immersed in rogue-like' computer games. These ASCII-based dungeon crawlers, with their procedurally generated levels, not only ignited his interest in systems design but also influenced the distinctive grey-scale style that has become synonymous with DEAFBEEF. ""That kind of cryptic visual aesthetic is imprinted on my consciousness,"" he says.""Not just ASCII, but oscilloscopes, scanline TVs, which come from my experiences with electrical engineering and signal processing.""  Retro-futuristic minimalism is only part of what has garnered him so much attention from collectors. Released in April 2021, Series 3 of the DEAFBEEF project gained widespread attention not only for its visual style, but for its innovative use of blockchain to explore the nature of web3 itself. Titled <a href="""" >Entropy</a>, the work degrades each time it is transferred; warbling synth lines becoming progressively noisier and cascading streaks of light fade into dullness. After a number of trades, the work becomes an eerie shadow of itself; a theremin heard from the end of a long hallway, a motion glimpsed through a silkscreen.  Though a relatively simple use of the blockchain, Entropy raises a multitude of possible meanings and interpretations. Consumerism, how we determine value, the nature of digital permanence, artificial scarcity  "" depending on your viewpoint, Entropy can speak to any one of these issues in a positive or negative light. ""The themes of permanence and ownership are central to blockchain technology,"" says DEAFBEEF.""It's almost a dogma of the [web3] culture but, in some ways, it's an illusion. Nothing is actually permanent, and so Entropy uses the medium itself to critically engage that theme.""  Series 4 and 5 take the question of permanence even further, rethinking the very nature of a minted NFTs as a finished work'. Instead, the buyers themselves become a random variable' that may generate unexpected outcomes  "" once minted the NFT retains a set of performable parameters that allow owners to endlessly tweak and vary the audiovisual output until they find something of aesthetic value. Every change of parameter, every new output is stored on-chain, creating a permanent catalogue of visual music curated by the community itself. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center"" style=""padding-bottom:45%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""45%"" data-rt-dimensions=""640:480"" data-page-url=""https://youtu.be/6fP0k6JZh4w""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fP0k6JZh4w"" title=""Entropy""></iframe> </figure> DEAFBEEF's own journey in web3 echoes the themes of exploration and discovery that are thematic of his work. He initially dismissed NFTs and only came to the web3 space after seeing other generative artists start to gain traction on platforms like Art Blocks. ""When I started, my motivation was not to have a career,"" he says of his early experiments.""It was like, oh, there's people who are actually interested, there's an audience for this. I'll just see where it goes'.""  ""I don't come from a traditional art background ... and yet, I was able to participate in this space.""    DEAFBEEF   Just over a year since the release of Series 0, interest in and appreciation of DEAFBEEF's work has skyrocketed. With this rise to prominence, a strong community has developed around DEAFBEEF  "" something that required some adjustment on part of the artist.""Before this, I very much valued working alone,"" he says.""For the last decade or so, I have been working in my basement writing code, or in my garage making things as a blacksmith. So, it was a big change coming to Twitter and Discord and having constant interactions.""   Despite such a radical change in how he works, DEAFBEEF says the community interaction that is intrinsic to web3 has been highly rewarding.""I don't subscribe to the notion of the pure author' that conceives of something and then disseminates it,"" he says.""I think of it as one big system, with the artist merely one sub-component of that system. Especially for generative art, a lot of the meaning-making comes from the community  "" it's like a feedback loop, and web3 is enabling those feedback loops and interactions."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:720px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""720px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62b073a6c288215ddb3e63ae_glitch2_182.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" > <figcaption > An excerpt from  <a href=""https://www.deafbeef.com/item/182""> Series 4 - Glitch: 182 </a> , by DEAFBEEF. </figcaption></figure> Asked whether we can expect Series 6 anytime soon, the answer is non-committal but enlightening.""I like to think in terms of albums, I like the extra meaning and context that you get from placing a track in comparison to the ones previous.

I'm interested exploring how blockchain can interface with physical and social systems. What form that takes I'm not sure.""  Examining the trajectory of DEAFBEEF's web3 career, it's clear just how democratising blockchain technology can be for musicians and artists, or, to look at it another way, just how unlikely DEAFBEEF's ascent would have been in traditional art and music scenes.   As he himself puts it:""I don't come from a traditional art background, I don't live in Paris or New York, and I'm not able to travel because of my personal life. And yet, I was able to participate in this space, for big stakes and with a lot of attention.

But everything you see is hosted by a few centralised storage players like Amazon and Google. That's a problem: when their servers go down, a big chunk of the Internet also goes kaputt. The underlying code and governance structures may be decentralised, but the continued reliance on centralised servers for the front shop of web3 projects hinders the purpose.  Could the massive realm of online data be stored decentrally, reducing this core dependency? A growing cluster of web3 sector around decentralised file storage solutions thinks so, and they're building a use case that anyone on the internet can benefit from  Proponents value decentralisation because it eliminates single points of failure. If data is stored decentrally across several nodes running independent of each other  "" unlike a giant Google server  "" then the risks of complete failure are significantly reduced, if not completely eliminated. ""We see that permanent, decentralised file storage has found strong product market fit in ensuring that assets traded in web3 apps, like NFTs, do not disappear,"" Sam Williams, founder and CEO of the decentralised file storage provider <a href=""https://twitter.com/samecwilliams"" >Arweave</a>, tells Culture3.  From web3 dApps to NFT art, data is central to the web3 experience and goes hand in hand with the wider web3 ethos. But the online infrastructure is crucial to everyone's experience. If decentralised file storage can ensure fast, safe, and secure data transfers online, then it presents a genuine use case for billions of online users around the world. It also makes possible an enormous scope of new opportunities built on a more secure way to store and share information on the internet.  Web3 technology  Arweave powers what it calls the""permaweb,"" a suite of applications and sites built on top of the blockchain, maintained by computers distributed around the world. Arweave also lets users store data permanently by paying a one-time storage fee, which varies by file size and network congestion at time of storage. Arweave maintains network security  "" guaranteeing that the files are indeed stored  "" through a cryptographic innovation called <a href=""https://www.kraken.com/en-gb/learn/what-is-arweave-ar"" >proof-of-access</a>, an alternative consensus mechanism, like proof-of-stake, designed specifically for Arweave. In proof-of-access the nodes will receive a computational request to confirm that the latest block and a randomly-picked past block still store the data. Other chains using proof-of-access include Filecoin, 0Chain, and Skynet.  Although many pixelated NFT artwork like <a href=""https://www.larvalabs.com/blog/2021-8-18-18-0/on-chain-CryptoPunks"" >CryptoPunks</a> or <a href=""https://mooncat.community/about"">MoonCats</a> with smaller file sizes are stored on-chain on Ethereum, the newly proof-of-stake chain isn't designed to hold large amounts of data. Ethereum requires the whole chain to be accounted for when running a node, which makes the costs of data storage prohibitive and ever-increasing. As of this writing, Ethereum <a href=""https://etherscan.io/chartsync/chaindefault"" >contains</a> around 900gb of data, up from 480gb the year before, and more than <a href=""https://www.blockchain.com/charts/blocks-size"">twice the size</a> of Bitcoin. It is a rapid increase, and bearing in mind that every node on the network has to store this data, one fraught with difficulties.  Most NFTs, or rather, the data files (like JPEGs) which the tokens point to, aren't stored decentrally. Instead, an NFT today is usually a data file that points to an image stored offchain. It's why purely on-chain work commands particular interest and value, because when it's offchain, it's more vulnerable. And it shows, because offchain NFTs <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkdj79/peoples-expensive-nfts-keep-vanishing-this-is-why"" >keep disappearing</a>: the total value of missing NFTs is estimated to be around <a href=""https://nft.storage/stats/"" >$918 million</a>, represented by more than a fifth of all NFTs ever created.  Daniel Norman, a developer advocate at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System"" >InterPlanetary File System</a>, one of the major providers in the sector, estimates that 75 zettabytes of data will be generated by 2025, all of which he believes should be stored onchain. That's 75 trillion gigabytes, so twelve zeroes. ""Centralised storage is limited to a small number of providers, limiting pricing and efficiency, and very little interoperability, leading to consumer lock-in,"" Daniel explains, adding that""storage is costly, and it is not always verifiable and immutable. This is why a decentralised, efficient, and robust foundation for storing information is needed.""  Use cases of decentralised storage  The impact of early providers can already be seen. Filecoin, which launched in October 2020, decentrally (but offchain) hosts the metadata and content of 80 million NFTs. It is also home to a large array of historically significant data, such as that provided by Starling Lab, a historical archive for journalists, lawyers, and academics. Founded by Stanford University and the USC Shoah Foundation, the research lab is using decentralised file storage to""meet the technical and ethical challenges of establishing trust in our most sensitive digital records."" To begin, Starling is preserving the testimonials of 55,000 genocide survivors, and has worked with Reuters to record contemporary events in Kurdistan and Myanmar. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""56.206088992974244%"" data-rt-dimensions=""854:480"" data-page-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOPRhf8B6wg""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FOPRhf8B6wg"" title=""Starling Case Study: The Testimony of Genocide""></iframe> </figure> In December 2022, they <a href=""https://twitter.com/RollingStone/status/1608466633852620802"">partnered with  Rolling Stone Magazine </a> to archive, authenticate, and draw attention to the Bijeljina massacre, which occured in Serbia in 1992. Preserving original photographs taken by photojournalist Ron Haviv, Starling ensures that this evidence, comprising photos, documents, and other sources, is not forgotten.  Marta Belcher, Chair of the Filecoin Foundation, tells Culture3 that this decentralised version of the Internet lets online data""stay up even if some nodes fail, and the availability of information is not dependent on any one server or company."" Other historical materials stored on Filecoin include video evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine, documents uploaded by nonprofits and newsrooms via MuckRock's DocumentCloud, and the City of New York's public datasets on climate and demographics. Belcher explains decentralised data storage""provides a more robust platform for humanity's most important information."" Information that society shouldn't risk ever forgetting.  Filecoin's network capacity is provided by over 4,000 storage providers from across the world. They have contributed more than 18 exabytes (EiB) of storage capacity. To put that in perspective, 18 exabytes amounts to all of the written works of humankind  "" from the beginning of recorded history to today  "" in all languages, multiplied by 20 times. Or 50 million hours of 4K video recording. Filecoin currently spearheads the space, holding about 90% of the total data stored on decentralised storage.  Filecoin was developed by Protocol Labs, who also produced IPFS. Whilst Filecoin provides the infrastructure for data preservation and verification, such as coin rewards to storage miners for storing data and to retrieval miners for serving data to those who need it, IPFS functions as a protocol for routing content. Think of it like decentralised https service. Data is stored and served elsewhere much like a website is, by Filecoin and other organisations such as Arwearve, but to do so they rely on IPFS, which tells them where the data is. ""It is evident that decentralised storage networks are inherently complex,"" Daniel acknowledges.""The ability to abstract that complexity so that users can be productive is a massive opportunity that depends on continuous feedback and evolution."" Today, that evolution is being driven by a""large network of contributors, communities, and companies"" in the decentralised storage ecosystem, directed at building the technical infrastructure to make Filecoin a seamless solution for non-technical users. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:900px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""900px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63248cb8f7692d5b1745b4d9_Nycmj8UQY2NurcCQNhbs7qVIt2NHZhjHpymX39TS_GmDjq8hy6z-ea33c1YeAm5xrbkylMOsY945pxKjo39aIYAPDS2Bxbad-rYEkLvLMH9Fkd8n5os-61xMn51Da1rk0w1vfVtoFzInl-qgZ5lQ02FoWxaH39m0zWbHHJLij1tUylobuxdhdTtizA.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > How users can interact with and store data using Filecoin. </figcaption></figure> One of the most anticipated developments in the decentralised data storage space is the forthcoming launch of the <a href=""https://fvm.filecoin.io"" >Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM)</a>. FVM will introduce programmable storage features like auctions and storage bounties to drive down the cost of storage, cross-chain bridges to the likes of Ethereum and SOla Kalejayena to make storing files more accessible, and Layer-2 solutions like better reputation systems to make the process much more efficient.  Web2 usability  Getting the average internet user to appreciate the complex data routing protocols and content addressing, and then use peer-to-peer storage networks to storage their data, feels like a big ask. Web2 is intuitive and heavily optimised for user experience. Indeed, entire careers are built around user experience design, working to make products more user-friendly. By contrast, web3 feels still geeky, like the early days of the Internet.  ‚Äã‚Äã""Decentralised file storage is a very complicated problem to solve; it has been on the table since the very early Ethereum,"" says an individual familiar with the decentralised storage provider Swarm, who preferred to remain anonymous. Swarm's hope is that this use case will be the tool to onboard new swathes of people into crypto. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1695px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1695px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63249f1200d7ce2955e8e988_swarm.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Swarm's  <a href=""https://ethswarm.org/""> desktop app </a>  makes scant mention of web3 terminology in a bid to appeal to mainstream users more interested in secure data storage than the technology that makes it possible. </figcaption></figure> With a goal""to take the best from web2 and replace the complex experience of web3 with a familiar one,"" Swarm's desktop app is consciously designed to feel like a web2 app, requiring no crypto knowledge from the user while affording the benefits of the underlying crypto tech stack without most users knowing it exists.  Another project trying to abstract away complexity and build a user-facing product is <a href=""https://fileverse.io"" >Fileverse</a>.  ""There are plenty of privacy, security, censorship resistance, and decentralisation benefits that could attract a wide range of internet users to these networks  and away from centralised services like Google, AWS, DropBox, Wetransfer, and so on,"" Fileverse's co-founder <a href=""https://twitter.com/miroyato"" >miroyato</a> told Culture3.

Her striking images capture human moments and portray emotions which transcend even the moment itself. Even photos of people simply living everyday life in its simplest definition: walking the streets, chatting with loved ones, observing the scenery. But what Deniz really captures in a split second of a camera's shutter is the human connection that lies within each moment. The life within these moments: the human struggles, palpable joy and love, and everything in between; that is what life is.  ""In photography, technique is important, but what is more important to me is that it has a real feeling,"" says Deniz, talking of her sincere focus to transfer emotion in her work. Through her photographic endeavors, Deniz travels the globe, exploring different cultures and communities, allowing her to reveal the similarities of the human connection. By bringing her work to web3, she has given photographs an even louder voice to unify people around the world.  Despite the enormous variety in Deniz's collections, all minted over the past 12 months, they share key themes as a unique and profound study of the world, honing in on the wonders of colour, life, love, and all in between. Whether in black and white or vibrant colour, her images turn mundane instances into an unexpected, personal, and at times vulnerable glimpse into the life of her subject  "" and the life of the viewer.   <em>Covid_19 in the World , Deniz's first foray into the NFT space, reflects the stress, separation, and fear that humanity collectively experienced during the pandemic. Several of her images evoke the loneliness and uncertainty that touched every continent: healthcare workers in protective gear, masked family members with looks of worry, people navigating the perils of the virus; the unprecedented moments of that distant and unfamiliar time.""After a short period of bewilderment, I gathered myself and thought that this pandemic, which surrounded the whole world, should be recorded.""

From cinema screens to advertisements, video without audio rings hollow. The $3 billion business of curating high-quality tunes and navigating the legal steps to pair them with the perfect media is known as sync licensing  "" and Keatly Haldeman is a master at it.  At Riptide Music Group, where he spent 8 years as CEO, he helped build a one-stop-shop for customers looking to licence music, combining a publishing company, record label, and sync-specialist into one streamlined service. Given the company's success, it came as a surprise to many when Keatly departed in early 2022 to throw his energy into Dequency, to create a decentralised sync licensing marketplace that could fix the problems inherent with the industry in web2.  However, Keatly's move didn't come out of the blue. He had been paying attention to web3 since 2017, though he did not yet fully appreciate the scope of web3's relevance at the time.""I didn't understand crypto,"" Keatly admits.""I hadn't taken the time to really learn about it  "" and I'm glad I hadn't, because it was way too early, and we would have failed.""   ""The royalty system is broken.""    Keatly Haldeman   As the web3 industry grew, those 2017 conversations were still in the back of Keatly's mind.""It always stuck with me. When I connected the dots  "" the idea of removing the middleman with smart contracts and bringing that to sync licensing  "" that's when the clouds parted.""  Alongside fellow industry experts Mark Ross and Professor George Howard, who had been one of the early advocates""waving the flag for sync licensing on the blockchain"", Keatly founded Dequency in 2021, originally planning to play a hands-off role at the company.""I had no intention of leaving Riptide,"" he says.""I was thinking I'm going to help build this thing, we'll hire an executive team to run it, and I'll just stay on as an advisor'."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:853px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""853px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63911325fdc36f483b9946a2_photo_2022-12-07_04-07-52.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Keatly Haldeman led Riptide Music Group from 2014 to 2022, when he left to built something better in web3. </figcaption></figure> However, momentum at the fledgling company quickly grew. After they received an offer from Borderless Capital, the respected web3 venture capital firm, to lead their fundraising round  "" contingent on Keatly leading Dequency as CEO  "" he was faced with a binary choice: stick with the traditional music industry or jump with both feet into web3. The offer of a six-figure grant from Algorand itself only added to the dilemma.  He recalls how George had been saying""this is important, we need to get this done"" for years. Ultimately, Keatly understood what George had been talking about, and opted to follow the action:""I've been in the traditional music industry for the last 20 years and the ideas that are happening in web3 are the most interesting that I've seen in my entire life,"" he says, emphatically.""The thought that I could take my experience, my passion for music, and my contacts to this new technology¶ that was really exciting.""  Those new ideas are easy to spot: blockchain and smart contracts are an entrepreneur's dream when multi-stakeholder contracts and financial flows are involved. In traditional music, royalty payments are notoriously inefficient, with hundreds of millions in earned income<a href=""https://www.billboard.com/pro/unclaimed-black-box-royalties-how-much-money/"" > never reaching artists</a> due to incomplete or inaccurate data.""The royalty system is broken,"" Keatly summarises.""The data is terrible  "" there's no central database; it takes nine months to receive your money; and it can take two or three years to get paid from foreign sources. It's just a nightmare.""  For independent artists, the prospect of not getting paid for months can be financially crippling. Dequency is built to fix that problem. On their web3 platform, which the company has <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dequency-raises-4-5m-to-build-decentralized-music-licensing-platform-on-algorand-301482573.html"">raised $4.5m</a> to build, once a media creator has found a song they want to use, they simply mint a licence using the platform's SmartSync contract and the artist, or rights holder, instantly receives payment. ""Blockchain can theoretically do away with the current system,"" says Keatly.""Every song is represented as a smart contract, which can have rights information, royalty splits, and payment structures embedded in.""  Of course, the legal aspects of music copyright are, and will remain, a complicated field. Dequency is moving cautiously to ensure that any new features are fit for purpose immediately after they launch: the platform today only supports single rights holders, for example, though introducing split royalties is a key target.  Similarly, Dequency currently handles only licences for web3 media such as NFTs and metaverse performances. But their long-term vision is to integrate traditional and web2 licensing into their ecosystem, with web3 serving as the underlying technology, rather than the competitive niche.   ""Blockchain can theoretically do away with the current system.""    Keatly Haldeman   Dequency has also introduced a series of artist-focused features that radically depart from the traditional licensing model. Many web2 licensing companies act as centralised gatekeepers between artists and those looking to purchase music rights: setting the price of the song's licence, taking commissions of up to 50%, and retaining approval rights' over who can licence a song and how it can be used.  An open marketplace, Dequency plans to be completely different. Artists on Dequency have the ability to set the license value for their music however they see fit. When someone wants to licence a song, they submit a request, and the artist has the final say on when and how their music is used. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1400px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1400px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/638fa1d88ca6a20a22b2b87a_requ-transformed.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > An example of how artists can have frictionless control over their work on Dequency. </figcaption></figure> This may sound like a small improvement, but the ability of artists to ensure that their work is only being used in projects that align with their personal values is a huge step forward in empowering independent creators. And with the structural freedom that web3 offers artists, who no longer rely on middlemen to distribute their work, there is reason to expect that use of these features will proliferate, rather than gather dust.  But before even getting to monetisation, the curatorial role of the licensing business plays a major role in which artists succeed and which are locked out of the industry. Curation is how customers know that the music database they are accessing has high quality melodies, but it fosters centralised curation  "" with a handful of people deciding what is and isn't good'.  Dequency's alternative is to access  "" and reward  "" the taste of their users, by re-imagining the core function of sync licensing as a community experience: curating a world-class music catalogue. Slated on Dequency the roadmap as Proof of Taste', Tastemakers' can earn tokens when their curated playlists get played, when artists appreciate their feedback, and by weeding out copyright infringement. Users can also stake these tokens in songs that they think will be licensed, whilst composers can share a percentage of licensing fees with the tastemakers who backed them. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/638f9ef0b76a2cc2c2b12cc9_Jbh6wK3eyYYk0Hw561BFqbgvibPO10W1Iz-mq2OOGo5N22-XLi3a7SzPJg03rJXvWFOXl2z3FTv1cCTTi5qdkASt-a7gZDM3hriFwwv9ACcVKMNSHVs-HWlKslJiJHLScNSoPml0P4VyUpOd9iQHSjUYd2xZQPNvYa8NNTeo34cjhCAK7QWr1dgcC5DOgw.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Keatly wants to reward listeners and artists for their curation by sharing a cut of royalty payments with those who help Dequency curate a world-class music catalogue. </figcaption></figure> In this way, Tastemakers will have the option to monetise their taste by getting a slice of the royalty payments flowing through the platform, and build their reputation too.""Next time someone challenges your taste in music  "" you can show them your stats,"" laughs Keatly.

Dilek Uyar is a lawyer and photographer from Ankara, Turkey. She's won the National Geographic Travel Photographer award and over 200 others. In conversation with Nina Knaack Knaack, she discuss the power of art, the necessity of making yourself heard, and how hard that can be, especially as a woman in Turkey and in web3.",Sun Nov 06 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Photography; Turkey; Asia,Nina Knaack," F. Dilek Uyar took up photography by means of contingency, but cannot imagine a life without it now. It's the tool through which she shares her views on cultural heritage and global affairs, the tool through which she accomplishes her mission to create awareness and initiate change.  Born in 1976 on the west coast of Turkey, Dilek is schooled as a lawyer. Her daily specialism is in labour and social security law, which she practises in Ankara. Before taking up photography twelve years ago, art was a world that she had explored little.""Art history and going to museums or the cinema attracted me, but photography didn't grasp my attention at all."" It was only because she wanted to take up a new hobby after her friend had just bought a camera that she thought of trying it for herself.""I think it's very important to have something for yourself to hold onto in life, besides just working and taking care of your family. In my case it became photography.""   ""I try to make a difference by making people visible.""    F. Dilek Uyar   However, taking up photography proved to be much harder than Dilek had imagined.""One with limited knowledge often assumes they know a lot already. I presumed I would take great photos as soon as I bought a proper camera,"" she explains.""I had to face reality when seeing the photos I took during my son's graduation: none of them were clear!""  Dilek isn't the type to read the manual, and even going to a photography course failed to get her where she expected to go.""I was mistaken again because I had the assumption that knowing the technical details of the camera and being able to set them were enough to take good photos. I was not yet aware of the fact that it is the person taking the photographs who makes the image a great one, by letting their personal background and emotions come through."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/636ba904705d8e1632478b01_battered.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xd7bc41f205679c3f056a1bd2857409e74baa03c6/12""> BATTERED </a> , by F.

You use the caption of light instead of words."" Less interested in wildlife and still life photography, she wants to tell the stories of cultures, their people, and their customs and politics.""This was because I experienced that photographs focusing on a specific subject, a culture, or a problem are remembered the most, rather than just beautiful landscape photographs. I try to make a difference by making people visible and giving them a voice.""  For her storytelling, Dilek has different personal motivations.""Most traditions within cultures change over time, or even disappear, because of technological developments and the modernism that comes with it. Photographs are my means to keep the memory of old traditions alive.""

""There's beautiful craftsmanship and so much knowledge in it,"" she explains.""Wisdom and traditions that shouldn't be forgotten. In my opinion, understanding your original culture is really important. Development is impossible for the societies that forget where they came from.""  Besides documenting historic values and traditions, Dilek sees it as her duty to show what is happening in her home country.""My lens is the eye for people who are not present in person."" She made a documentary photography series about cancer patients and when Covid-19 hit, Dilek didn't hesitate to place herself at its epicentre.""It is the biggest event affecting the lives of all people around the world since World War II and I strongly believe that these happenings should be documented. It felt like I didn't have a choice. I just knew I had to be there. I had to photograph, at any cost.""  Dilek believes an artist should be a role model in terms of actions, expressions, and stance.""An artist shouldn't be indifferent to the world around them and should have a point of view. I deeply believe in the importance of focusing on the problematic issues within the society."" Her biggest aim is to increase social awareness and inspire young women in her country. ""It's really hard to go your own way as a woman in Turkey. Social and educational inequality are among subjects I prioritise as a woman, and a mother."" She deliberately selects topics which she perceives as urgent instead of the ones she finds attractive.""If you use art properly, it is a really strong form of propaganda and a driving force to initiate change.""   ""I had to photograph, at any cost.""    F. Dilek Uyar   In late 2021, friends rung Dilek to convince her to create NFTs.""I hadn't really made any money from photography until then. Even from winning awards you don't earn much."" Her friends told her about a new revolution in art called NFTs. Even though everything seemed too complex for her in the beginning technology wise, she slowly understood how she could use web3 to spread her messages worldwide. Just like she learnt how to use the camera, she learnt how to use the blockchain.  Dilek recognises similar treatment as a woman in web3 as she has done in Turkey. That motivates her even more.""It is difficult for us to cope. It is not easy to be properly appreciated in a male-dominated atmosphere in which nude women's bodies or sexy shoots are given much more priority. I strive for the appreciation of the real art in this world. I am a warrior woman; never in my life have I obtained anything easily. I've always had to cope with hardships and exclusion,"" she says.""I am willing to fight to be able to change things in the world and let our voices be heard through art."" ",1840
Dispatch from Denver: Ethereum Builds through the Bear Market,dispatch from denver ethereum builds through the bear market,Sun Mar 05 2023 15:26:28,"Tens of thousands of enthusiasts gathered for the world's largest Ethereum conference in Denver, Colorado. Jeff Benson explores how the builders are shaping up during the bear market.",Sun Mar 05 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Community-society,Conference; Usa; Ethereum; Ethdenver,Jeff," When ETHDenver 2022 kicked off last winter, the industry was at the tail-end of an extended sugar rush of high token prices, crazy startup valuations and, of course, the pandemic. Lines to get into a crumbling Sports Castle snaked around the block. People I spoke to  "" regular people like lawyers, business owners, artists  "" said they came just to see what crypto was all about and how they might get into web3.  That was a year ago. 2023 is very different. Layoffs are piling up, depressed token prices aren't inspiring the general public to buy the dip, and NFT might as well stand for""no friggin' thanks.""  So you might expect this year's ETHDenver, which ends today after a multi-week series of hackathons, speakers, and side events, to be a smaller and more subdued affair than last year.  And you'd be wrong.  My first clue that this was going to be a bigger deal than ever was the line to get in. There were the typical technical issues slowing things down, but it's also just hard to register over 10,000 people per day. I waited for two hours to get my credentials on Thursday  and that was in the""express"" lane. By the time I reached the desk, I discovered the WiFi wasn't working and the check-in system was busted. The volunteer wrote my name down on paper and handed me a media pass. Welcome to Denver. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2048px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2048px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6404b1207d01f772c8373ab1_51924480553_5b69170af6_k.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Crowds at ETH Denver. Tens of thousands of attendees descended on the Mile High City for the 2023 conference. </figcaption></figure> The National Western Complex, where ETHDenver is being held for the first time this year, is an expo center designed for agricultural trade shows and cattle events. It's sprawling and was crawling with crypto fanatics  all hawking products and protocols or talking the latest in Ethereum development. ""It's a bear market and look at how many vendors there are,"" says Anett Rolikova, from Hyperlane, a blockchain interoperability company.""There are so many sponsors that this venue feels more like an expo and less like a conference.""  That's just the main level. There's a massive cavern of coders working beneath as part of the hackathon. It wasn't until Day 3 that, while wandering around the inside of the building, I stumbled upon a poker tournament, a maker space, and rows and rows of tables for builders.  The increased space to play with has let projects get creative with their booths. Ethereum wallet MetaMask and infrastructure provider Infura ran an escape room, Giveth, the crypto donation platform, coordinated a POAP scavenger hunt, DAO Game7 set up an entire videogame neighborhood, and venture capital platform CultDAO was handing out masks and hinting at mischief. Hundreds of booths, filled with stickers and swag, filled the space. Rarely, if ever, has such a large group of people been so enthusiastic about Ethereum infrastructure and decentralised apps.  If crypto is dead, nobody's told these folks. Talk was mostly devoid of prices and valuations, which is normal for this conference. ETHDenver sees itself as the""longest running Ethereum #BUIDLathon in the world."" It's a builder crowd.  Anna Stone, Executive Director of the universal basic income project GoodDollar and Head of Impact at eToro, tells me""it is clear that the Ethereum community is really strong despite what's happening with prices, speculation, and the external capital markets. There's a lot of innovation and building happening here.""  Hyperlane's Rolikova mostly agreed.""Last year, I probably felt a little bit more of a builders' energy from the actual conference itself. But I feel like the spirit is still very high.""  Any drop in building' energy is in partly due to the layout of the venue. In previous years, the centre stage was near the entrance, with booths and a few side stages relegated to the upper levels. Everything was all mixed this year, making it hard sometimes to hear what speakers were saying. The main stage was down one level, in the depths of the building. Though it was isolated from the hubbub, you could also attend the whole conference without realising it was there. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:947px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""947px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6404a8109d7341860bb07f61_328999201_543055967895207_731810122537220410_n_2.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > ETHDenver 2023 took place at the National Western Complex.

The foot traffic is nonstop all day."" Sadaf's colleague Nic echoes the spirit, noting that the conference represented a time to regroup and remember why they're here.""I think with the news most of the year so far  with Terra, with the exchanges going down, with all that  I think the vibe is really here."" He noted a groundswell""toward decentralization and the importance of decentralised protocols"" now that FTX, a centralised exchange, had collapsed.  Beyond decentralised finance, a strong theme of regenerative finance emerged in Denver, championed by Colorado native and Gitcoin co-founder Kevin Owocki. On Saturday, he publicly announced Supermodular, an incubator for ReFi products.   ""The foot traffic is nonstop all day.""    Sadaf.eth, ENS Labs   Stone could feel it in the thin Rocky Mountain air. The GoodDollar Director observed""a real discussion around public goods and what is the role of crypto in developing public networks and advancing public goods.""  She was discouraged, however, that the conference was not more representative, though she admits it has become more diverse every year since she first attended in 2018.""It's still such a poor representation of what our world looks like. There's a lot of white men in every room all the time. That does not necessarily bode well if we're looking at the future of finance and trying to make that more inclusive.""  It could be said that the bear market had stalled some of the progress in onboarding a more diverse user base. To be sure, there were signs that this wasn't your bull market crypto conference. Haseeb Qureshi, founder of Dragonfly Capital, participated in a fireside chat on how bear markets were good for building. Acknowledging that a lot of the general public that hopped on the crypto bandwagon had hopped back off when it became too difficult to navigate web3, he encouraged attendees to focus on building solutions that people could actually use. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2048px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2048px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6404b19aab4b63a135bc65c7_51924337661_644200107e_o%20(1).jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > A group at ETHDenver.

One sponsored breakfast I went to was well-attended but not at all flashy.""Can you believe the line for some bagels?"" one attendee asked.   It's a small point but a useful indicator; side events are designed to lure conference attendees from the main attraction, often with open bars and fancy spreads. One account manager for a major PR firm told me that the side events were""weird"" this year. She noted that many were co-sponsored by multiple entities, a sign of belt-tightening in marketing budgets.  Others are feeling it too. By coincidence, I shared a Lyft from the airport with the head of a web3 production company that had been built on Terra, now also collapsed. He was there to shoot video for a Cosmos side conference. In years past, he explained that he would have come out for a whole week; at any one point, he might be working with a team of 70. He was down to a team of three and just flying in for the day.

Whether fairytales or nightmares, her often startling paintings and macabre drawings explore the sinister and the beauty that can co-exist in our minds.  Known as Dolce Paganne in web3, the Turkish-born surrealist has exhibited her art in galleries in the UK, the US, France, Australia, and others, but has found a welcoming and diverse community in the NFT space to further her creative vision.  Based in Antwerp, Dolce sees herself as a voodoo artist, and her artwork depicts a visual examination of the depth of magic and belief.  ""I see all artists as the animist sorcerers of primitive times and I locate myself on the darker side of the magic scale."" Through her works, Dolce tries to communicate her broader ideas about life, consciousness, and death.""I believe that death is a part of the joy of life and my works project this idea.""  With subjects that are always captivating, but on either side of the line between discomfort and eerie beauty, her paintings have a vintage and almost psychedelic feel, with smooth brushstrokes and a serene sense of movement and flow in her work that stirs up nostalgic feelings, rendering a kind of comfort amidst the fear. Her complex drawings and sketches carry a whimsical tone in their lightness, despite their often malevolent scenes.   ""I see all artists as the animist sorcerers of primitive times.""    Dolce Paganne   When discussing her process to make these complex, layered creations come to life, Dolce speaks of the deep introspection that her work requires.  ""I need totally isolated leisure time to focus on the visions inside my head, where I record all my past memories. Sounds, tastes, and touch are all a part of it."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:50%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""50%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62d088e5da5d2d58e69734ad_dp333.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/156777""> The Empress </a>, by Dolce Paganne, is inspired by Marie Antoinette and tarot cards</figcaption></figure> Without a dime given to social norms and reality, Dolce renders these elusive moments into their uncanny and precise visual form.""When I think of my all-time inspirations, I can locate antique fairytales and myths to a corner, art history to another corner, wild nature, anatomy, horror comics, popular culture, music, death...,"" she muses.  Aside from her visions, otherworldly dreams, and the countless artists that provide inspiration from both on and off the blockchain, Dolce shares that her secret weapon is a curated <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2y8K7Tyro2Ow7uh8eetZgM?si=jJVx-Sh8SdqEQEAWYb8LJA"" >playlist</a> that ranges from electronic music, to jazz, to psyche-trance.  ""These days it's Eric Truffaz, Leifur James, La Femme, Vitalic, Ten Walls, Lucien &amp; the Kimono Orchestras, and Weval.""  In her captivating dreamscapes, Dolce explores concepts relating to""life, death, innocence, sex, passion, guilt, fear, and escape."" This ability to encapsulate a plethora of these topics into a culturally emotive piece of work is where her creations transcend. The beauty in Dolce's artwork is that, within the scenes that she sets, which are often dark or haunting, lie topics we fear, and issues that stalk our society.  Dolce minted her first solo exhibition in the traditional art world,  Paradise Inc. , on Tezos, and it exudes a thorough exploration of her intrinsic thought process in a layered study of humankind. Based on the famous""Garden of Eden"" by Hieronymous Bosch, the Early Netherlandish painter from the late 15th century, Dolce's pencil and ink linework offers a contemporary update to the old-world masterpiece.  A triptych, with three distinct sections through which Dolce perceives humans as ""consumerist, selfish, hedonistic beings"", the piece is quite literally layered with fantasy worlds that reflect society. In the three-part story, the left section depicts contemporary paradise, the middle depicts the reasons behind our addictive society, and on the right are the worst consequences of the consumerist world. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2048px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2048px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62d08830f5b3482e46d6a8ae_dp4444.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/157911""> Paradise Inc. </a>, by Dolce Peganne</figcaption></figure> Proven to embrace boundary pushing and the otherworldly, the NFT community has been a welcome space for Dolce to continue her creative endeavours.

So, I started chopping up orchestral pieces, sampling, and doing my poetry over it."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3084px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3084px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63910579fdc36f3b88985a02_domino-card.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Domino's first experience with performance art was as a card magician.""It's one of the oldest performance arts to exist, and it ties into every craft that we know today."" </figcaption></figure> Even in the early days, Domino says that he prized creative control, and was determined that his career path would be an independent one.""It's always been embedded in my head that this could just be a grassroots type of thing,"" he says.""But I always wholeheartedly believed in having 100 superfans over 10,000 casual listeners."" Inspired by artists like Mac Miller and Chance The Rapper, Domino pushed himself to learn the skills necessary to produce, promote, and distribute his music. By the time that the web3 music scene was beginning to take off at the start of 2021, Domino was already primed and ready to take full advantage. ""I started out by dropping visual pieces with music,"" says Domino.""I was leading people to my songs through visual art, drawings, film, photography, and poetry."" Those breadcrumb trails worked, and by the time he was getting ready to roll out his album,<a href=""https://www.dominosmusic.com/presessence-vol-1"" >  Presessence Vol.1 </a>, Domino had an engaged web3 community that was ready to follow him wherever he was taking them.  The album stands out not only for its songwriting, but also for the sophisticated  "" and uniquely web3  "" approach taken in its release. Beginning with weekly drops, Domino alternated between different art forms, always paired with music, offering oblique fragments of the album's themes and narratives. It proved to be a highly influential approach, with artists like Jagwar Twin following<a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/jagwar-twin"" > similar release strategies</a> for their recent albums. ""It made people think of the music differently and connect with it on a deeper level,"" he says.""There were things, like hidden phone numbers, in the drops that would tell stories. There were lots of things that not many people saw, but the people who got it, really got it. The whole point of volume one was to say: if you're here, if you're present, this is going to be special.""  Conceptualised as the first of three parts,  Vol. 1  sets the stage for a self-reflective examination of Domino's career and goals as an artist.""The whole trilogy is an exploration of success and what that means to me,"" he says. The story is set inside a limo, with the narrator in transit to win a fictional music award. As the car rolls on towards its destination, the artist reflects on his life and the path that has lead him to a moment of recognition within the industry.   ""This release is so much more than just the music.""    Domino  ""As a young artist, you're like I want this, I need this, it's my version of success'. <em>Vol. 2  will take off right from that moment  "" the feeling of winning and being so high, and then the aftermath of that, which is what I've been experiencing this last year.""  The release of  Presessence Vol.1  was a breakout success, generating $175,000 in primary sales and setting a new standard for immersive web3 music releases. Dropping in October 2021, the album arrived with seven original artworks  "" one for each track. Alongside the music itself, Domino also released a series of<a href=""https://www.niftygateway.com/collections/dominopresessence"" > cinematic dance NFTs</a> on Nifty Gateway created in collaboration with some of LA's hottest young choreographers, and <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/presessence"" >a third collection</a> containing all the NFTs that dropped in the lead up to the album. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1066px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1066px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6390b10f38d4715d7b2260f2_gjq8Ys_-6f7edf-irwmtwy44ACYdmAQ14GZUfJ_axSFyLujnYkWxlh2Zo2EYrixvLboOmwXUEz9SQUpxRjuYvGVcAPQnU2W0OEU6WR_5wCT4h-Cwy_SVQnVvzU_8Yvw1qMQ8y1MJSmYbkOvJPgBgdyoW-tiv_gkyqDP6lk_cJ9dyXcf_YiKz9CA3NmLP.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Domino's multi-media presence ranges from film, dance, visual art, and poetry to music. </figcaption></figure> Since then, Domino has been hard at work on the second instalment of the trilogy, breaking up his writing schedule with metaverse concerts in Decentraland and in-person performances at venues such as The Peppermint Club in LA.

""I'm making sure that this music will be the best thing that I've ever made.""    Domino   Talking to Domino, one is struck by the sheer breadth of knowledge, competency, and talent needed to pull together such multi-layered projects. However, getting pulled in too many directions is something that the artist is extremely conscious of:""You have to do everything  "" you have to be the marketer, you have to be social media savvy, you have to know how to talk to other artists, but also how to talk to the people that are funding things. There are so many things that come into play.""  With so many plates to keep spinning, an artist needs one overriding goal, one centre of gravity that pulls their entire project together. For Domino, that centre is his songs and the stories that they tell.""No matter what,"" he says.""I'm making sure that this music will be the best thing that I've ever made and, hopefully, the best thing that people have heard, too.""

Sweet Dreamz: celebrating sex and sexuality through NFTs,dreamz,Fri Dec 30 2022 10:25:25,"Dreamz' art is an expression of human love and a celebration of the female body.

Dreamz is a 3D digital artist intent on  turning Dreamz into reality .""I want to redefine the perception of reality by showcasing hyper realistic art,"" he says. Influenced by Japanese culture and aesthetics,  Cyberpunk 2077 , and the tropes of  Dune ,  Blade Runner , and  Love, Death and Robots , Dreamz takes on a futuristic style in his artwork.""I like exploring neon, hyper realistic, and in-your-face elements to further explore the boundaries of what reality can potentially be,"" he explains.   ""I see web3 as a never ending possibility""   Dreamz   Through these futuristic elements, Dreamz' creates an open dialogue on the themes of reality, love, and sex.""I perceive the futuristic elements and sexual themes working together to reshape how people perceive love, respect, and stereotypes for women.""

""Web3 opened my eyes to the different possibilities of what art is and can be. There are certain things that can only be done in the web3 space, like minting, coding, and pushing the boundaries of what is possible through different mediums."" With a background as a musician, and a future as a mainly visual artist, Dreamz appreciates the opportunities emerging from web3 for all types of creators.""I see web3 as a never ending possibility  there are unlimited ways to grow in this space,"" he says.  Dreamz uses DAZ 3D, Cinema 4D, and After Effects to create his digital art. Drawing inspiration from the sex work industry, Dreamz is currently working on his  100 DAYS of NFTs  series. The collection features a different woman every day for 100 days, influenced by his girlfriend and her friends.""Each piece has a part of my girlfriend in it in some way  one character is even a lookalike of her,"" he explains. Dreamz has a different vision for each of these characters.""I can envision all of these characters being a part of multiple projects, or becoming figures in video games, anime, comic books, or potentially even web3 influencers. I want to give a purpose to these art pieces.""  Dreamz' art goes deeper than what meets the eye. Although many of his NFTs portray beautiful women, Dreamz says that he wants to""develop characters with personalities."" It is the characters and meaning behind the  100 DAYS  series that add a layer of depth to his artwork.""I want these women to be actual characters with a personality, who are treated with love and respect  it's about more than just their physicality.

His art frames the complexities of these women, showing that they are more than just their bodies. Meanwhile, he is conscious about creating art that embraces women for who they are, inside and out, in a positive, respectful, and compelling way. Although his characters may be seen wearing audacious clothing, Dreamz is intent on developing his 100 Day series in a way that depicts each woman as a fully fleshed out persona. ""I think that the web3 community needs to be smart about their moves, especially as younger generations are getting involved. In this phase of overwhelming social media exposure, kids are not really aware of sexuality in a healthy way. Sexual content should be more beautiful and celebratory, instead of overly sexualised and unrealistic.""  Dreamz' art, although embodying a futuristic style, aims to show women as real people, with an array of things to offer, their sexuality being only one.""I'm trying to make sexual content more about art.

How Ebuka Mordi became an Adobe photographer using just his iPhone,ebuka mordi,Wed Aug 17 2022 16:17:27,"Ebuka Mordi prides himself in his ability to ""pick up any device"" and create an incredible image. To him, what matters is 'how was this photo made?', not 'what was used to take this?' He spoke to Signal about the method behind his rapid success in the space, and why web3 is a much better place to produce his work than in his native Nigeria.",Wed Aug 17 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Photography; Digital-Art; Nigeria; Africa,Signal,"  When Beyonce shot the cover of US Vogue in September 2018, she reportedly had creative control of the entire shoot  from writing captions, curating images, to recruiting the team. This level of editorial control was unprecedented as she also recruited the photographer, an up-and-coming black professional whose career seismically changed post-shoot.  After interviewing Nigerian NFT photographer and visual artist Ebuka Mordi, it jolted a memory. Flicking through fashion magazines in the 90s and early 2000s, few black models were featured on the pages. The ones who were lucky enough to make it were styled and lighted in a way that was never quite relatable. The hair, the make-up, and the skin tones always felt foreign, never familiar, never aspirational, and not like me.  I am on Zoom with Ebuka, a hugely talented photographer turned NFT visual artist. His work is fresh, the style is clean, and the photographs are crisp. Either you are staring at his portfolio thinking, how were these images taken', or you are thinking, have I seen this photo in a campaign.' If there was ever an up-and-coming photographer that a black celebrity needed to recruit for a shoot, Ebuka Mordi's name should be on the recommendations list.   ç <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:852px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""852px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62fd10ab91d47229026aaa95_tezUixPVuLHwm2k81hkNA8rd0gWK5p0yHRzGGQ57i17fVORRscOvyJVuUqNgsa_ZkQp12Ayh_1dgkiglG0C6sBp0zFaLwWAb6KatMXJmCXGMW1VHxfldKOwcvCQD7-q4TbBUfIdeInstbzeS9g8CTxY.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1SpZYFSKCj2NkYyxAHFuoj97FutnuCsFb1/9""> Composure </a> , by Ebuka Mordi. </figcaption></figure> Ebuka is an accomplished photographer himself. His images are featured in Vogue Italia, and he advises Adobe on improving their Lightroom suite, an opportunity that came about due to his highly sought-after post-production skills. Browsing his portfolio, images are immaculately lit, perfectly colour graded, and models look relatable  like friends, relatives, or people we've met.   Mordi has grit, the type you hear about on TED Talks, a level of persistence born out of necessity. Ten years ago, he picked up an iPod Touch and started shooting his friends at school. It was a hobby, and he knew the low-budget gear would never produce the same quality as a DSLR, so he developed an edge, focusing on post-production editing techniques. ""When I produce photos people don't ask 'what was used to take this photo?' Instead they think 'how was this photo made?' I think those are two different questions. I focused on my editing techniques and it gave me confidence to pick up any device.""  Ebuka's efforts paid off to the extent that, when he entered NFTs on his first day, without even listing the item, someone made an offer for a piece, which sold for 0.2eth. It sounds easy, but he has worked tirelessly to get to the point that he is at today. He has been posting evocative and captivating portraits on Instagram for almost a decade.""In Nigeria, photographers are not respected, people think it's a side-hustle, and they don't value your work even if you're booked. Once I charged $30 for sixty photos and three videos, which was around 12 hours of work, so this shows how bad it is."" In the past, when he sold his prints to an international collector, prohibitively expensive international shipping costs made it virtually impossible to make a living from his craft. Now, as an NFT artist, the distribution costs are significantly reduced, and potential collectors are located anywhere. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1271px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1271px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62fd10ac4db473fd6a2e7efb__nH6VuqK3hTeTA4NKGZq4qMs1-CCe_QszfpjtsplMxVBcDEYL5Ym2WElYvtQqWBUHNCGcvfaBbX7Tt7Ef4FWnnJy5Z3RFOnqpf-zPF4t0hI_4tGgq7o6ruSmP1OZaQrlnb5GabYfweedk4eaCD8L4Ic.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1SpZYFSKCj2NkYyxAHFuoj97FutnuCsFb1/0""> Liberty </a> , by Ebuka Mordi. </figcaption></figure> Ebuka takes a two-pronged perspective on his career. Firstly, he uses blockchain technology as distribution; secondly, he leverages content creation on different platforms. Both of these avenues allow him to grow exponentially faster than his peers. Whether it's Instagram reels, Skillshare, or YouTube, he makes content about the process of creating art, which is extremely popular with his audience. ""I had this idea, I documented the whole process, and I found out that many people loved the documentary because they saw how art was created. They watched every single detail; and putting that into a video is also a form of art because art is about relating to something.""  This creative process is predicated on practicality, but his followers love the content because they see his mistakes, intuition, and vulnerability. It is like watching Kanye West create a new beat in real-time: an illuminating artistic process for the audience. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center"" style=""padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""33.723653395784545%"" data-rt-dimensions=""854:480"" data-page-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Y4y40NpLg&ab_channel=EbukaMordi""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/X1Y4y40NpLg"" title=""Taking self portraits with a Drone!? || V-log""></iframe> </figure> Including his followers in the creation process is part of Ebuka's magic. One of his stand-out collections was born from a tweet. He asked his Twitter followers which device he should use for a self-portrait  iPhone, DSLR, or a drone , and his audience answered drone'. This sparked an idea to create a piece in which he would photograph himself in hundreds of different poses, dressed in the same clothes, and then pool the images together in post-production. The outcome is an original collection called <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/amongst-the-corporate-giants""> Amongst the Corporate Giants </a>, a series telling the story of""societal giants and those who wish to follow in the paths they create"".  Ebuka's post-production skills are his speciality; he can pick up any camera and produce exceptional photography. His collection <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/ibinola"" > Ibinola </a> made the OpenSea front page after he photographed images of his friend and model performing a wind dance. Ibinola dances in the blazing sun, shirtless and sweaty, wearing jeans, flat shoes,""reflecting on the year 2021 and how he hopes to soar further in 2022 as he expends so much energy."" The series is evocative, a testament to his talent that you don't need a state-of-the-art camera to yield art of this calibre.  As an artist, Ebuka goes the extra mile for his collectors. He shipped physical prints from Nigeria to France, paid out of his own pocket because he knew the collector would appreciate having it in their home. He believes in creating art that does not need to be introduced or described. It's for the observer to interpret the work and find moments within the piece that evoke an emotional response. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62fd10ac1441bbe401c3694c_7y73xF6e5fWtPX3cpU4_trPyXRNV2SslT87OXb3COR563P9eQLrpH1QId5wpZTlSfLfGLvKcs52C48DqMPRCRbV0eGQJzr7ugr-SDd5Y6JHYmkweU9U3t_2HJYpNERK1L67HTdGjK-XhS96hfCHSz2Y.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/51082641443820473803318409807995596753001585459316189646274989700507007713281""><em>Tide </a> , by Ebuka Mordi. </figcaption></figure> Photographers do not have the same level of attention that collectibles achieve. Ebuka believes this is due to photography being an individual profession rather than a community activity. He believes that this can change however if""communities and artists come together and build a roadmap of what they want to create or what they want to portray."" Indeed, the voices of photographers in NFTs are not as loud as collectibles, but the two realms co-exist alongside each other. Profits from collectibles rotate into art, and notable artists set the example that art can appreciate and be appreciated; beautiful things can still yield a return.  Artists like Ebuka who started their NFT journey even in the past year are at a considerable advantage over those yet to discover the technology. By being considerate and thoughtful to the body of work he wishes to make, he creates a loyal community of collectors who choose to support his talent. The next Peter Lindbergh will not be anointed by the industry, they will be moulded and born out of web3 because they were curious enough to learn about the technology, build a community, and continuously add-value.

" ""Web3 feels like you don't need the industry""  how Ed Balloon is making a music career on his own terms",ed balloon,Fri Jul 22 2022 16:11:54,"After forming his first band at the age of 10, Ed Balloon struggled to break through as a cross-genre musician. His is a story of how serendipity and moments of inspiration come to the persistent and the committed, and how web3 gave this Boston-born artist an opportunity to share his message that he's taking full advantage of.",Fri Jul 22 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Music,Stop-Motion; Usa; North-America; Cross-Genre,Ola Kalejaye," An important lesson we can take from the emergence of the NFT art space is the expansive effect of technological innovation on artists, culture creators, and curators alike. Indeed, the agency and autonomy that web3 affords artists makes constant apearances in the endless array of deeply personal and occasionally esoteric displays of creativity that we get from artists charting the path forward in this new domain. One such artist is the musician, visual artist, and community builder, Ed Balloon.  In discussing some of the early life environments that deepened his love of music, Ed only briefly touches on the challenges his family faced while he was growing up in the projects in Boston, in a government-subsidised affordable housing complex. Rather, it's the summers spent in Texas at his uncle's house that stick out to him. But, suffice to say, Ed didn't enjoy his time in Texas. He's only half-joking as he recalls those hot summers. ""We were legit in the house all day. I could not. I have trauma from just being in the house all day. And then when you do have the chance to go outside you're just running from wasps.""  Despite the unpleasant memories, or perhaps directly because of them, it's those times that come to mind when discussing his origins as a performer. Music became a respite, as it does for so many. And as far as what he listened to at the time, Ed credits his sister as the music curator in the family. She was the one to put Ed on to the icons who were shaping popular music in the 90s.""She was listening to Tupac  "" and she was young to be listening to Tupac!  "", Monica, Michael and Janet [Jackson]; all these artists in the 90s. And so here I am listening to them too.""  It was around the age of 10 that Ed finally had  the moment : the realisation that he didn't just love listening to music, but he wanted to make some of his own. Wasting little time, Ed went out to recruit his first ever music group.""I had these neighbors who were also Nigerian, and I was like, 'we should be a music group'. And I forced my little brother into it. So my neighbors were the two rappers, I was a singer, and there were two other singers.""   ""I've always been the dude who was a different person.""    Ed Balloon   The group was the fun experiment that also served as Ed's first step on his artistic journey. He started learning how to write songs and how to put together parts for his bandmates. Though as self-assured as 10-year-old Ed was in drafting his own band, the nerves flooded through when it came to singing in front of other people. Whilst you would never guess from his commanding stage presence and natural talent as a performer, Ed says that his performance anxiety has been worse at times in his later career.  Ed reflects openly on the issues of perception that have coloured much of his career. Particularly, he worries if audiences will understand, his particular sensibilities and collage of influences.""I've always been the dude who was a different person. Like, I somehow was listening to The Beatles in the projects. That's not saying that all Black kids can't listen to The Beatles, but my dad had a catalogue of music that was so diverse. Motown was in there, The Beatles were in there, Barry White. I'm out here listening to Abba, which is crazy.""  With music that scoffs at the idea of genre, it is difficult to put Ed's sound in a box. Over the course of just one Ed Balloon song, you hear pop, punk rock, R&amp;B, dance music, and hip-hop all flowing in and out of each other, colliding at times. Failing to understand artists who don't fit neatly into a genre is one of the many well-catalogued flaws of today's music industry. It's something that Ed has had to jostle with throughout his career. ""It's so unfortunate because I think that has prevented my career from flourishing in a way. Especially in web2, right? Like, 'oh we can't really put you in a genre', or 'we don't really know what you're making'. They're not too sure if it's sellable until they see another artist doing it that has the clout and the platform. Then it's okay."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1350px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1350px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62dacbd775808f6713633bcc_ed-b-home%401x.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Ed Balloon as a stop motion animated silicone puppet, the star of The Run Ed collection and the TV pilot being funded by his community. </figcaption></figure> Of course, this challenge for music executives to see an artist beyond the framework of genre only grows more complex for Black artists. After all, when it comes to Black art, there is always some level of bias that, subconsciously or otherwise, informs the expectations of the audience. Being conscious of this feeds into Ed's worries around perception, as well as frustrations with an industry that has struggled to overcome any expectations stemming from his identity.  ""Is it different because I'm a Black artist doing work that you, quote unquote, 'don't see other Black artists do'? Is that why you deem it not sellable?"" He adds, ""because if I was to see a white person doing all these things, it now becomes something that fits. And I don't think the limited lens or perspective that is put on Black artists is fair, but that's where we are.""  The particular struggles faced by creators of colour notwithstanding, Ed has never let industry pressures divert him from creating in his own individual way. And as far as guiding lights go, his is as good a directive as any.""If the art is good, the art is fucking good. If the song is good, the song is fucking good. It should always be that at the end of the day.""  It was in 2019, after some time pursuing music part-time with his band in Boston, that Ed finally took the plunge and moved to LA to fully pursue a career in music. He and the band stayed laser focused from day one, seeking to avoid a fate that Ed saw in other artists struggling to make their way in the world's entertainment capital.""Coming to LA, I encountered a lot of people saying that they just get lost sometimes. Not by their own fault, it's just so easy, especially being here. So I told my band we have to make sure that we are on the floor hustling.""  The hard work paid off. By the end of 2019, Ed and his bandmates were able to bag a touring spot with an artist who was doing well at the time. Finally, Ed thought that he was at the point of breakthrough.  But that was in late 2019. You already know what came next.  The birth of Ed B ""The Puppet""   As so many artists were forced to do in light of Covid, Ed began searching for new ways to get his music out there. He was particularly focused on giving his audience more than the""boring af"" offerings he was seeing from other artists, and spent a lot of time ideating different ways to present himself digitally. But in the end, inspiration found him. ""I remember watching a Wes Anderson movie, Isle of Dogs. I thought it was claymation at the time but it's not, it's silicone puppets. And I was like, 'this is so nice'. If we could do something like that just had me in a different type of form, we could use that as a way to do our performances.""  Ed started calling around, exploring his options. As luck would have it, a friend connected him with a stop motion animator. After consulting and sending pictures of himself as a reference, Ed B ""The Puppet"" was born.  While the initial plan was to use Ed B as a stand-in for music performances, the next major shockwave of 2020 sent Ed and his team going in a different direction. ""This was right when George Floyd was killed, and then all the other killings."" Immediately Ed went from ""oh, we're making songs with it,"" to, ""I don't want to do anything, I don't want to sing anything, I'm upset. I want to use my voice differently. I've made songs already talking about these issues. What can I do to showcase this through animation?""  A fan of satirical comedies in the vein of  The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  and the animated television show  The Boondocks , Ed chose satire as the right tone to strike with for Ed B. The first product was  Potato Salad , a clever 20-second stop motion sketch using the allegory of a white friend making potato salad with raisins to comment on misguided allyship.  Potato Salad, along with three other Ed B sketches posted on his YouTube, began to form the foundation for a larger project. Ed started collaborating with colleagues on the Ed B fronted  The Puppet Show . But just as he had experienced, in his music career, gaining traction proved difficult.""We were working on this pilot script, and we got it done. But it was so difficult to get it out to people and have people see it. And then even having people see it, it wouldn't go anywhere."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:75%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""75%"" data-rt-dimensions=""640:480"" data-page-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iyLr8P5244&ab_channel=EdBalloon""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/1iyLr8P5244"" title=""Potato Salad PSA | Ed B &quot;The Puppet&quot;""></iframe> </figure> This was just the tip of the iceberg during a brutal period in 2021. As he struggled to get both his music and the TV pilot off the ground, his band had another tour canceled. Then one of his bandmates left the band. And to top it all off, Ed came down with Covid soon later. As he so succinctly puts it, he""took all of the Ls.""  Yet it was exactly the rock bottom of quarantining with Covid that presented Ed with a new passion that would drastically alter the trajectory of his career.  Ed B, meet web3   Ed spent a lot of time on Twitter as he isOla Kalejayeted in his roommate's apartment, mostly promoting his music. As it happened, he had been using Ed B as his Twitter profile picture long before he discovered the world of NFT PFPs. Which, of course, is what happened during that quarantine.  Ed had heard of NFTs before without exploring the space in any substantial way. He certainly wasn't seeking it out on Twitter. No, Ed's true web3 journey started with a chance sighting of photographer Brittany Pierre entering a Twitter Space about NFTs. The two were mutual followers, though not acquainted at the time. That the two now co-host a regular Twitter Space for the BIPOC NFT community only makes Brittany's role in Ed's introduction to web3 that much more serendipitous. ""I was exposed to a lot just in that one Space. The next Space I went into was way more the WAGMI spirit, though it's probably different now, but I saw people surround this artist. And that artist sold out in that Space, and I was like, 'oh my gosh'. And that did it for me."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" style=""max-width:60%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright"" data-rt-max-width=""60%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62daca65807034afc870d1b1_ED%20B_RUN.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >The gif loop from The Run Ed collection.</figcaption></figure> Having longed for support throughout his career, the NFT environment was beyond a welcome change for Ed. And ultimately, it's the joy of seeing artists helping each other out and lifting each other up which has left a lasting mark him. Indeed, it's that community support from other people in web3 that gave Ed the confidence to sell his first NFTs. That put him on a path to sell out an NFT collection of his own, The Run Ed Collection, starring Ed B ""The Puppet"" racing through beautifully animated landscapes, the proceeds of which will be half reserved to fund the pilot for The Ed B ""The Puppet"" show, and half to a fund run by Ed to collect art from under-represented creators in web3. It was the success of this collection, which has done 33 eth in volume, that also led to him being featured in the TIMEPieces x Timbaland <a href=""https://time.com/collection/timepieces-x-timbaland-the-beatclub-collection/6167825/ed-balloon/"">collection</a>. ""It's the independence that I really love about (web3). I think sometimes people feel like, 'if I don't have the industry behind me, I can't do it'. At least right now, web3 feels like you don't need the industry to do something. You don't need the industry to put out an NFT. You don't need the industry to tell you, 'this is not gonna work'.""  Effusive as he is with his love of the space, Ed acknowledges that he sees more of what he calls""web2 behaviors"" creeping in. As money and interest have surged into all areas of NFT art, some artists have retreated to a scarcity mindset; the mutual support within the community doesn't feel quite as mutual as it once did.  It's this trend that inspired Ed's latest song and music video. As he explains,  You're Not Giving Enough , ostensibly about someone imploring a lover to invest more in their relationship, is something of a call to action for his fellow artists and builders in web3.""There can be times in the space when you feel like you're exhausted and you're giving all you can, but every time you're not getting enough to be able to sustain and to keep giving. And I can be honest: of course I love this space and I'm so bullish on it, but it's not all roses.""   You're Not Giving Enough  was itself another source of anxiety for Ed. As his first NFT that wasn't focused on Ed B, he was putting himself out there in a way he hadn't ever done before. The music video and accompanying song perfectly merge the art of performance that Ed has always held so dear with the digital mediums he is newly exploring. If it was a risk, it certainly paid off. The song received a large positive reception, with the music video selling at auction through the Digital Diaspora platform for 9 ETH to Will Savas, just before <a href=""https://www.culture3.com/posts/nft-nyc-coverage-3"">NFT.NYC</a>.  But web3 has done far more than give Ed a pathway to craft a career on his terms. It's also given him a new purpose in doing so: building a community and paying forward the support that has got him where he is. Ed sees himself as a builder first, and an artist only second. ""I just know what it feels like to not have help. So if I'm in a place to help people, why not? That is the beauty of it, and I just hope that we see more of that. Because I do think sometimes when you have people putting your name in lights, the sense of entitlement can come through.  ""But why I was bullish on the space and why I will still be bullish on the space is because I saw artists helping other artists, which I'd never thought I would see."" ",4254
Education redefined: how augmented reality is changing the way we Lea Rose Emeryrn,education redefined how augmented reality is changing the way we Lea Rose Emeryrn,Sun Jan 22 2023 13:34:56,"The global EdTech market is expected to reach over $230 billion by 2028, with over $20 billion of institutional investment in 2021 alone. AR will, without question, play a big part in this growth. Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg explores how augmented reality is already changing the world of education and what to expect in the future. ",Fri Jan 27 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Metaverse,Augmented-Reality-2; Education; Applications,Randy Ginsburg," The value of  doing , when it comes to education, is no secret. Achieving more immersive learning experiences has always been impactful for teaching, but the cost of achieving this for a class of thirty students (and across millions of classes) has always made it inaccessible for all but the most privileged learners.  Augmented reality offers a new medium for education and exploration, bridging the gap of experiential learning while allowing students of all ages to visualise their subject matter within the context of their surroundings. As toddlers reach for iPads before uttering their first words and AI writing tools render basic essays useless, it is not only clear that education  should  change, but that it  can.   And many entrepreneurs and investors seem to think so as well. Valued at $85 billion in 2021, the global EdTech market is expected to reach over $230 billion by 2028, with over <a href=""https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/education/our-insights/five-trends-to-watch-in-the-edtech-industry"" >$20 billion of institutional investment</a> in 2021 alone. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63d3b6e3f480afab5df9d5c0_7kghp8fdZf_COocjN-GzTpr-l6N0uFFegAzNu_Jw_P92jfSZH8SRstY3LmRP791XWfq8w2CZEGnyaeNP4-w8eYOC5v54AyBp8VX4Lncgv3afgHwwF_WLvXJ6J7fn0BvWXgc4AFqgExVPumBCdBNfWVsYhj_KpJ9C75RQ1nTqG7Qa-uFfHoFmtH7xwQorUw.gif""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Catchy Words AR helps students to learn to spell by walking around the classroom and collecting letters. </figcaption></figure> Augmented reality, one of the most significant trends in the burgeoning EdTech sector, is a technology that enhances, or augments, the real world by overlaying real-life objects with a digital layer. When a user points their phone (or other camera-equipped device, like AR glasses) at an object, augmented reality software recognises what the camera sees and outfits digital content on top of the video feed. As the device moves, the size and orientation of the AR display move automatically with it, creating an engaging and immersive user experience.  While AR is far from new  Snapchat filters and Poki©mon GO demonstrate successful early experiments  recent advancements in both software and hardware have begun to shift its perception from a toy into a valuable tool for educators and students of all ages.  Much of the excitement around AR is centred around its digital real-time responsiveness, which generates an immersive 3D experience that is more memorable than bullet points in a text book. Using interactive apps like <a href=""https://twiceapps.com/catchy/catchy.html"" >Catchy Words AR</a>, young students can walk around their classroom collecting letters to learn how to spell; <a href=""https://edu.assemblrworld.com/?utm_source=website%20assemblr&utm_medium=home&utm_campaign=assemblr%20edu%20from%20assemblr%20web"" >Assemblr Edu</a> replaces standard textbooks, posters, and diagrams with a library of ready-to-use 3D and AR-enabled learning materials across all subjects; and Arloon Geometry allows students to explore the ins and outs of geometric shapes in 3D.  Touch Surgery helps students to simulate emergency situations and practice surgeries on virtual patients. Perfect for visual learners, these tools allow students to safely  experience  the subject matter at hand, rather than just read about it. And in experience-intensive fields like medicine, this experiential learning can make all the difference.  Since 2020, students at Case Western University have had access to fully remote lessons using AR headsets manufactured by Microsoft's HoloLens. Using the headset, students are able to explore the anatomy of the human body in 3D, helping them to develop an understanding that is much more robust than anything that they could learn from a textbook alone. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""56.206088992974244%"" data-rt-dimensions=""854:480"" data-page-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PEUU2EhOk0&t=37s""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/4PEUU2EhOk0?start=37"" title=""""></iframe> </figure> With smartphones in the developed world being almost ubiquitous, and <a href=""https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world"" >over 86% of the entire world's population</a> owning one, augmented reality has the potential to improve education, reducing the need for textbooks and other static materials, making high-quality teaching methods accessible for all.  Indeed, using AR, students may not even need to be in the classroom, given advancements in remote learning tools like 3D Bear which empower teachers to create 3D learning environments packed with gamified lesson plans, 3D avatars, AR stories, and video recordings. And this is only the beginning. While smartphones are currently the de-facto device for AR engagement, within the next decade, it is widely expected that AR headsets will become a staple of everyday life too. ""It expands access to opportunity,"" explains Ellysse Dick, Policy Manager in Meta's AR division, Reality Labs, speaking to <a href=""https://www.govtech.com/education/k-12/report-finds-promise-for-ar-vr-in-k-12-and-higher-ed"" >Gov Tech</a>.""A virtual field trip isn't a full replacement for a real-life field trip, but for students who wouldn't be able to <a href=""https://www.govtech.com/education/k-12/lincoln-high-school-students-get-their-hands-on-google-augmented-reality-.html"" >visit these places</a>, AR and VR can give them opportunities to experience some of those things.""  But like all emerging technologies, there are two sides to the coin. Today, augmented reality comes with an augmented price tag, making it out of reach for most schools, for now, and particularly when many face budget constraints that limit their ability to purchase basic supplies.  Change also takes time. Even those who have access to the necessary resources and hardware are faced with the challenge of putting these new methods into practice. For augmented reality to truly transform the way that we learn, it should be embedded in curriculums and learning on a day-to-day basis. And that requires multiple layers of support from officials, schools, teachers, alongside enough relevant content for them to teach with. ""There are some sticking points that are holding it back. People want to put it in classrooms, but content is a huge issue. There's not a lot of relevant content out there,"" Ellysse says.""Understanding how these technologies can fit into existing curricula needs to happen before this can explode in the way that a lot of people would like to see it.""  Still, despite current costs and limited understanding, the potential of AR education is clear to see. And whilst changes to the school curriculum will have to come from teachers, enterprise-oriented educational applications of AR will push down prices and help innovators understand how the tech can be best used.   ""It expands access to opportunity.""    Ellysse Dick, Meta   Museums like the Art Gallery of Ontario and The Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC are using AR apps so that visitors can better experience how ancient people and animals would look and work in real life, whilst Star Chart, an AR-powered database built for astronomy enthusiasts, lets users explore over 120,000 stars and 88 different constellations. Even government organisations like NASA and the U.S. Marine Corps are using AR to simulate intensive training and deliver real-time mission-critical information. <br>  As for what the future holds, big tech executives as well as educators are confident that augmented reality will play an important role in how we engage with information. Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously cited AR as a""critically important part of Apple's future,"" with the company's first AR product expected to debut this year. Mark Zuckerberg's interest in extended reality is well documented, and the Meta CEO is <a href=""https://www.zdnet.com/article/mark-zuckerberg-calls-ar-glasses-one-of-the-hardest-technical-challenges-of-the-decade/"" >ambitious for augmented reality</a> too, predicting that the tech""can be the next computing platform"". Whether this technology will become a staple of our education system, only time will tell. But it deserves a role. ",2475
" ""At a certain point you end up feeling like you're not winning""  in conversation with Angel Ese-Oghene Ikuewan",ese,Tue Sep 27 2022 18:08:40,"Rising NFT artist, fashion designer and philanthropic entrepreneur, Angel Ese-Oghene Ikuewan wears many hats. She speaks to Antony Rahman about her journey, using web3 to support Africa's creative youth, and the intersection of fashion, digital art, and web3.",Tue Sep 27 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,3d-Art; Fashion; Nigeria; Africa,Antony," Angel Ese-Oghene Ikuewan was 12 years old when she took her first steps on the long, tumultuous, and exciting path to being the artist she is today. The spark? Receiving a sewing machine as a gift from her mother; she immediately set about indulging her creative spirit by bringing to life a variety of clothing designs. It was the the first real spark for passion and proclivity for fashion that has only grown since.  Known to web3 as Ese, she went on to study fashion in Lagos, and is currently studying architecture alongside her work as a designer and an artist. She mainly works in 3D art, inspired by her experiences growing up in Lagos, plus her experience finding her place in society, web3, and the world as a whole.  The young Nigerian sees art primarily as a medium for storytelling, each piece a scene with a freestanding narrative within.""My art tries to depict scenes not necessarily grounded in reality, but representing a fantastical version of it, isolating a single moment in time and exploring the story told in that span."" This facet of her artwork is on full display in <a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1KGYBAcCa4iV3WYXwcX1R2oMuzPgnTdvyd/3"" > Rage </a>, a stylised representation of her own bedroom during times of profound inner distress.  The piece came about as a form of venting, created while she was far from home and dealing with a great deal of upheaval.  ""I wanted to recreate what emotional trauma feels like; how it looks.  Rage  is a very honest and candid digital depiction of a mental state that would tend to manifest, by my actions, into the physical state of my room."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63333ba8f14aabfd78a2b5c7__p60VP9OMcKyJ0yHXkwBK2ywexn6WS9DgT86UduusuY7coV78D-RlbzZx6uT_qybCVKfeQWfGF-mszsr7CFzXVsSgRgNZuL100YshMFEKi80ZEMnJJhs5hB_JAMg31fpvBtL313k6IfzPC4mN-fyJhX-qUvFvjhnWyilo3pLg8VAeAQFbbEaKJTDew.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption >  ""I wanted to recreate what emotional trauma feels like, how it looks.""  <a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1KGYBAcCa4iV3WYXwcX1R2oMuzPgnTdvyd/3"" > Rage </a> , by Ese. </figcaption></figure> Though the narrative being expressed differs from piece to piece,""the lives of African men and women,"" as she puts it, is a recurring theme. She pushes for representation in her art as much as she pushes for it in her daily life.  ""I often feel underrepresented, both in the media I see being consumed, and in social situations, so I push for it in every way I can"", she explains.""I want to constantly challenge what people are comfortable with, what they see as right, what they see as common.""   ""I wanted to recreate what emotional trauma feels like; how it looks.""    Ese-Oghene Ikuewan  ""Not just in my art but in social situations and in conversations. I want to challenge the norm not when it is convenient or easy to do so, but when I feel it is the right thing to do. I try to ask, why does this make you feel uncomfortable? Why, for example, is something that doesn't directly impact your happiness so distasteful to you?""  Ese attributes much of her initial drive, passion, and continued success to her mother.""My mother was a very creative woman, expressing herself by way of unique interior design and engaging me in many of her creative fashion design projects,"" she reflects.""To this day she directly assists me with a lot of my creative projects, and is my greatest artistic influence.""  As a digital artist, it was almost inevitable that she would eventually delve into web3. She fully leapt down the rabbit-hole, committing several weeks to researching all the intricacies of NFTs, the marketplaces, and the history soon after first coming across the term.  That is not to say that this undertaking was by any means easy. Ese's journey got off to a shaky start: after minting her first NFT in May 2021, she withdrew from the space for several months.""It was too much to handle for me at the time,"" Ese recalls.""I personally found the NFT community can be a very toxic one in certain ways. I've found the space is not particularly kind to African women.""  She felt excluded from conversations, and never truly felt acceptance; perpetually an outsider. But the most problematic form that toxicity takes in this space is the kind that isn't even truly malicious, or specifically directed. ""As an NFT artist, I was constantly flooded with stories of other artists' sales, posts about other artists' wins, at a certain point you end up feeling like you're not winning. The space is flooded with all of these success stories, of people being supported by their communities and achieving great things and making good money. I started to wonder, why can't I see that success? Why can't I get that support? Is there something wrong with me?""  People are naturally excited by the novelty of the technology, she concedes, and the unexplored potential therein. But she argues that it results in an unspoken agreement to promote only the stories of the high-flyers, the people who are shining examples of the idea that artists can make it, thanks to NFTs.'""It was easy to forget sometimes that just because you aren't winning right now, doesn't mean your work has no value, or that you as an artist shouldn't be appreciated.""  She adds that there aren't many people putting in the hours to lay down for newcomers how things work in web3, what happens after an NFT is minted, and the many complexities that are involved in every step of the process. While these things can be researched for oneself, it can be a painstaking process.""At the beginning, no one was there to give me their time to say, these are the things you need to do, these are the things you need to avoid.""  After a period of thorough research, building contacts within the space, and learning all she could about the technology and the culture around it, Ese eventually resumed her work in NFTs. This was undeniably the technology of the future, she thought, and the potential in it was staggering.  Often described as an eccentric, Angel embraced the label in her web3 moniker, adopting the pseudonym Esentric', a synthesis of the word with her own name. Staying true to the moniker, she does not confine herself to a single path. While digital art is a skill that she continues to refine today, she also invests a portion of her time in creating immersive virtual fashion shows, creating a blend that has been growing in popularity in the fashion world. She also brings in the sewing machine, creating the physical versions of the dresses by hand, as well as rendering them in 3D designs. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3838px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3838px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63334f6882fe6dc8ba5ac8f4_lexis_clipdrop-enhance.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Part of Angel's  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKjCSJVM7m0""> Defining Lexis </a>  collection. </figcaption></figure>""The potential of virtual fashion shows is vast and as of yet only barely explored through avenues such as digital fashion week NYC,"" Ese says enthusiastically, noting that <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/shavonne-wong"">even very few artists in the NFT space</a> have recognised the opportunity.""It is not truly big yet, but as web3 continues to leak into the mainstream consciousness, I believe virtual fashion shows will eventually eclipse conventional fashion shows, with the digital versions of the dresses on display becoming valuable NFTs.""  Despite all she has achieved, Angel does not plan to sit on her laurels. In addition to future exhibitions in fashion and art, she is paying increasing attention to charitable projects like <a href=""https://twitter.com/LZYutesclub"" >LZYutes</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/XrenderC"" >Xrender</a>, working with young creators in Nigeria and around the world.""I love to dabble in things, and all I can say is I still see myself in web3, because this technology is the future, and I would love to see how far it will go.""

Times have changed since George Bernard Shaw made this assertion in his 1903 drama series,  Man and Superman , because in the early days of web3, those who can't do, may eventually learn, and those who can teach often do it all.  For architect and design educator Pablo Garcia, learning and teaching are intrinsically linked.""I've always loved creating art and design work that utilises technology,"" he says. An Associate Professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, he has found a multidisciplinary ecosystem to earn a living, instruct others, and satisfy his curiosities that drive his creative pursuits. Drawing upon his talents as an illustrator and the shared interests of his collaborative team, Ethnology is an NFT project inspired by cultures all over the world to explore new stories and mythologies and inspire art that sustains them on-chain. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6315e46d70d1372f16753eba_YMOo3n-OKtJyYqxql8S4gh8WBI2g4H95L2c8Hqyw-29fNVQeJE-JmdWkjHbLjGOolPQ-wbYkNA8ZRfnr_Z2rebj90ZHjIAXTbTz9RY05J0OGQYfGZlaCvwKhyP1h_1IFqN-Auq-_A9pUn0QshieNK2Mk4jRUK8dUnljA0_aMlHcnYHopzglk4XkYOg.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Pablo Garcia  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBCSFu-a3kU"" > speaking </a>  at TEDxVienna in 2017. </figcaption></figure> There are 10,000 original characters in  Gods and Demons , the second Ethnology series.  Gods and Demons  illustrates the world's religions, myths, and legends as artistic symbols that have been remixed to communicate interpretations and imaginings new and old. In doing so,  Gods and Demons  is an aesthetic interpretation of syncretism, where integrating discrete traditions and the joining of different belief systems  like theology and religion  encourages unity with an inclusive perspective of other faiths.  Generative art collectibles often utilise the many visual aspects of a character, shuffle them all in different combinations, and produce thousands of unique NFTs in the process. It's like playing a slot machine and making a work of art from the set of images that pop up. Each one of those visual aspects, traits, have been coded and scripted to randomly combine and align with several other traits 10,000 times to make 10,000 original NFTs.   ""It's a dialogue and conversation; it was a mind-bending exercise to sit down and draw all these parts.""    Pablo Garcia   The artwork representing each NFT isn't entirely unlike the others, yet is altogether different, with its own unique combination of computer-assembled assets. To create thousands of combinations, Pablo drew hundreds of different traits by hand onto acetate.

How web3 gave Fifi Rong a new connection with her fans,fifi rong,Fri Dec 23 2022 13:22:23,"A fiercely independent artist, Fifi Rong has carved a career path as unique as her music. In the Lea Rose Emeryd up to her forthcoming EP, she speaks with Clovis McEvoy about drawing inspiration from her heritage, making sacrifices for art, and the paradigm shift of web3.",Fri Dec 23 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Music,Grime; Opera; Reggae; Indie-Pop; Asia; China,Clovis McEvoy,"""It was considered impossible by my family, they thought I was crazy in the beginning,"" says Fifi Rong, and, under the circumstances, it's not hard to see why they felt that way. These days, the Chinese-British artist can point to any number of career highlights  "" she's collaborated with trip-hop trailblazer, Tricky, toured her music internationally, and now works at the forefront of the web3 music industry  "" but when Fifi first set foot in the UK, aged 16 and with only herself to depend on, the challenge of becoming a professional musician seemed insurmountable. ""This was not an easy choice; it was a huge risk,"" she continues.""The obstacles  "" psychological, cultural, practical  "" were just so high. But I went for it because I wanted to do impossible things."" Having that clear-eyed sense of the challenges ahead, and the dogged determination necessary to overcome them, was key to how Fifi has not only built a successful career, but remained resolutely independent throughout.  Of course, becoming a""one woman music factory"", as she describes herself, did not happen overnight. Upon her arrival in the UK, Fifi's initial steps were the practical ones laid out by her family: she studied Economics and ultimately attained a master's degree in the field. Yet all the while, she was growing increasingly convinced that her long-held dream of making music was not as far-fetched as she ha'd been told.""It's like supply and demand,"" Fifi says, recalling her thought process at the time.""I am a rarity here; other Chinese people have gone back to their parents, or gone into accounting or banking. There are very few who choose music, and this makes my work special."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1500px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1500px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63a5ba2a92f7aa1199450bc3_fifi-rong-1.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >  ""I took on this dark, no one can fuck with me' look  "" and hey, I dominate this vibe""  Fifi Rong. </figcaption></figure> Since her first release in 2013, Fifi has indeed brought a distinctive perspective to her music, establishing herself as a multigenre producer and songwriter capable of blending an array of eastern and western influences.""I have carried Chinese Opera, from my time in China, over to my music ‚Å† all those revolutionary songs that I absorbed from my parents,"" she says.""But then I was also hugely influenced by dubstep, grime, UK garage, and reggae.""  The resulting music is a dark and luscious brand of avant-garde pop that filters both traditional and modern influences through Fifi's distinctive aesthetic. However, while she felt comfortable bringing Chinese culture into her music, Fifi says she initially resisted drawing upon those same influences to create the striking imagery that has now become so intimately associated with her work.   ""Web3 gives artists the encouragement to get their true selves out there, whatever that is.""    Fifi Rong  ""I was very hesitant,"" she recalls.""I didn't want to show my face, I didn't want to be seen as a Barbie doll and get called beautiful. I hated all that. I just wanted people to listen to my music."" Over time, Fifi says she grew more comfortable experimenting with her image in fashion and visual arts, seeing it as another opportunity to showcase the rich visual traditions that she grew up with and further distinguish herself within the UK music scene. ""From the start, I wanted to bring my culture into the West,"" she says.""To show that there is so much more to Chinese culture than many people realise. Most people have just seen Hollywood movies with Geisha or something. So, I took on this dark, no one can fuck with me' look  "" and hey, I dominate this vibe."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:700px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""700px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63a5ba83a264e9992e0b2284_a3615971294_16.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >There Is A Funeral In My Heart, For Every Man I Loved , a double album featuring 12 original tracks, written, recorded, and produced by Fifi Rong. </figcaption></figure> Perhaps the purest expression of Fifi's musical style to date came with 2021's double album,<a href=""https://fifirong.com/new-album"" >  There Is A Funeral In My Heart, For Every Man I Loved </a>. Released in both English and Chinese, the album  "" which Fifi wrote, recorded, and produced  "" is a remarkable achievement for a solo artist. Made over the course of five years, and whittled down from over 100 demos, its 12 original tracks centre around a woman caught in a cycle of love and loss; repeatedly choosing to reach out for a connection, whilst knowing that she will eventually be forced to let go.  Originally written in English, Fifi chose not to translate her lyrics for the Chinese version of the album. Instead, using the same melodies, she rewrote the lyrics for her native tongue, capturing the""creative intention"" of the English original, whilst adding deeper layers of cultural meaning to the album's deeply cathartic narrative.""I've seen myself, from the very beginning, as a poet,"" she reflects.""When I was very young, before I had any idea that I had musical talent, I would write; I would mark down and document my emotional life because I wanted to be understood.""  In the months leading up to the album's release, Fifi was simultaneously beginning to take note of the still embryonic web3 music scene, and ultimately became one of the earliest musicians to engage with the space.  In contrast to many other artists, when Fifi first began to experiment with blockchain technology, she was already well-versed in the kind of independent monetisation and fan-building strategies now associated with web3. She had already successfully crowdfunded a number of her EP's and albums without record label backing, built an engaged online community, and experimented with innovative perks for backers and fans, such as VIP chats and group calls. In terms of her career, moving into this new space was less a radical departure as it was a natural progression towards the values that she had always prized  "" freedom, creativity, and independence.  However, where Fifi did see an immediate paradigm shift between web2 and web3 was in the tone and tenor of her interactions with supporters.""In web3 there's less of a hierarchy in the relationship between the artists and the fans,"" she says.""I'm not on a pedestal, and I think that's much better from a mental health perspective for the artist.""  As she began releasing tracks from her double album as NFTs, Fifi quickly found that the walls and facades which felt necessary in web2 had fallen away, leaving her able to bring a new authenticity to her interactions.""I don't want to put on a persona,"" she says.""I have a very primal need to be understood and that's why I write songs. I want people to understand the subtlety and the truth that's in me  "" but in web2, the bigger you are as an artist, the more of a persona you need to put on. This place is the opposite; I can be fully myself here.""  Since her first NFT drops, Fifi has flourished in the web3 music scene. She's released a number of sold-out collections, and, in early 2022, partnered with fellow web3 pioneer, Nifty Sax to create the<a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/harmony-nft"" >  Harmony Collection </a>. The saxophonist and web3 label owner  "" with whom Fifi also works at the Nifty Music Academy to support aspiring musicians in web3  "" is known for his spacious and calming instrumental music. Together, they released a set of seven meditative tracks. Drawing inspiration from the chakras found across numerous Asian philosophical and religious traditions, the music is a gorgeously ambient amalgamation of their two styles.  In parallel with her  Harmony Collection  project, Fifi also began her ambitious<a href=""https://fifirong.com/yi-jing-live"" >  Yi Jing Live </a> video series. Drawing deeply from Chinese history, mythology, and culture, Fifi takes the concept of a live in the studio' performance and elevates it into something dreamlike and ephemeral. With the production value and artistic vision of a short film, each episode is bursting with vivid colour and evocative imagery, intended to""translate"" what Fifi does musically into the visual realm.   ""The transition to web3 has impacted my whole being.""    Fifi Rong  ""There's a beautiful, long history  "" we claim 5,000 years of history in China  "" and you can really go back and make a cultural bridge from there to the West,"" she says.""So, I'm playing with the avant garde, with sexiness, with tradition, to express the combination of two different origins. That combination is something unique, and that is extremely important to my art.""  Having recently wrapped up filming season one, she's hard at work planning  Yi Jing  season two, which is intended to tie into a forthcoming series of EPs and NFT releases. The first in this new musical series,<a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x023199e32bd34c9958eeed4eb75ffd30c1877a17/0"" >  Hopium ,</a> is set for release in early 2023, and Fifi says it will be her biggest web3 project yet. However, she makes it clear that these EPs will also mark a change in direction from 2021's double album."" There Is A Funeral In My Heart  was kind of extreme,"" says Fifi.""It was the best I could possibly do and went deep into this melancholic romanticism' vibe. I wouldn't want to compete with myself. Next, I'd like to do something bold, something fun."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1272px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1272px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63a5b9000f968b6ab508d109_hopium.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Fifi Rong's  Hopium , an EP featuring Beijing opera, trip hop, hyper pop, and ambient soundscapes. </figcaption></figure>  Hopium  charts her journey in the web3 space so far, and will embrace the new level of creative freedom that the community has given her.""With  Hopium ,"" she explains,""I'm putting in Beijing opera, trip hop, and hyper pop, together with ambient soundscapes ‚Å† sometimes within one track! Because I'm free. Who can tell me that I can't do this? Web3 gives artists the encouragement to get their true selves out there, whatever that is.""  Running through Fifi's career, and the themes that she explores within her work, is a fearless pursuit of the right to self-expression. To follow one's creative whims, wherever they may lead, is a privilege that some might take for granted, but one that Fifi has sacrificed much to achieve. Music was not a luxury, nor an idle pursuit, but the vehicle through which she attained personal freedom.  Within web3, Fifi has finally found a community which matches her values. Becoming part of that community has, in turn, profoundly impacted Fifi's art and her very conception of what a music career can be.""Web3 is a catalyst,"" she says.""Sometimes one catalyst can trigger a knock-on effect in your entire life. In web2, we only knew one definition of what it means to be successful in music. Through the emergence of web3, I started to question what success means. This transition that I have taken has impacted my whole being."" ",3314

They called it Flow, and the chain went live in May 2020.  Although most chains took a plunge during the crypto bear market that began in late 2021, Flow has continued to grow.

In doing so, Dapper Labs has produced a network that retains much of the benefits of programmable money and smart contracts, which it blends with advantages in scalability, usability, and security to create a very different type of blockchain: one where transactions take ten seconds and cost less than a penny, and one that's been identified by the NBA and Ticketmaster to underpin their NFT offerings, the latter of which has already minted over 5 million tickets on Flow.  The second distinguishing quality is""developer ergonomics."" Flow has a number of rare features  "" that is, not shared by most blockchains  "" like upgradeable smart contracts and built-in logging support to the <a href=""https://developers.flow.com/tools/emulator/index"" >Flow Emulator</a>, the chain's main developer tool.

Top Flow projects: sports and gaming galore  All this has meant that some of the world's biggest brands have built their web3 initiatives on Flow.

More than 10,000 developers and 1,000 apps are using Flow, per figures shared by Dapper Labs with Culture3, and the blockchain's first DAO, Emerald City, runs <a href=""https://academy.ecdao.org"" >bootcamps</a> to teach Cadence. Collectively, these companies have raised $3.5 billion from 400 investors to build on Flow (excluding the $600m raised by Dapper Labs to build the Flow itself).

" ""If this doesn't work, I'm going to forget about my art dream forever""  how web3 helped Foleee fall in love with drawing again",foleee,Tue Jun 21 2022 09:43:18,"Foleee's natural talent helped him stand out in his youth, but over time, it gave way to career necessity. Speaking to Ola Kalejaye Kalejaye, Foleee explains how web3 helped him rediscover his love of drawing.",Tue Jun 21 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Digital-Art; Paintings-2; Latin-America,Ola Kalejaye," When it comes to NFTs, there are many styles of digital art whose very essence is in lockstep with the exciting new medium. Be it the memic dystopia of a Beeple, the generative masterworks of <a href=""https://www.culture3.com/posts/deafbeef"">DEAFBEEF</a>, or even the stunningly minimalist pixel art of the CryptoPunks, much of the art that has come to be synonymous with NFTs fits that mold. There is an ongoing dialogue between art and medium, whether the art is directly commenting on web3 technology, or simply a refined product of it.  Then there are other artists whose work calls back to the beauty and intricacy of classical pieces. This art inhabits the digital space, yet could easily find a home on canvas. In these works, there is a wonderful dichotomy: art whose foundational inspirations stretch back centuries, housed in a technology still in its adolescence. It is in this juxtaposition of the historical and the pioneering that Foleee's work resides.  For as long as he can remember, Foleee has been an artist, even if the journey he's taken to identify himself as one has been long and not without its struggle.""I always loved to draw, and I've always connected with art. Since I was a kid, I've always loved doing portraits. For me, it was kind of natural."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:887px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""887px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62b18b84eb63f27178bf50d2_hello%20master%20(OBJKT).jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" > <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1N5iHkuTw5W6Xk847PW5ifui2j9SPzJPKV/5""> Hello Master </a> , by Foleee </figcaption></figure> Indeed, Foleee's digital paintings call to mind the deeply textured and emotive works of the Renaissance masters. Even back in his childhood, drawing sketches of his favorite cartoon characters, Foleee has always been captivated by portraiture and the way it stirs emotion, telling the story of a subject with light and shadow crafted by the hands of the artist.""I would say it's different things that just light a spark. Sometimes it's how light reflects on a face. Sometimes it's the reflection of the eyes. It's not easy to define in words.""  As Foleee tells it, he would spend every possible moment with a pencil in hand, drawing portraits of whatever drew his attention as a child. That said, the Uruguayan's early relationship with art was a complicated one. Enrolled in an art workshop by his mother in his pre-teens, Foleee's teacher would have him recreate her pencil portraits while the rest of the workshop would do the usual, simplistic sketches. He understands today that this was because his teacher saw something significant in his work, but he felt discouraged after being separated from his peers at the time.""As a kid, you always want to be part [of the group] and I felt like I was doing something totally different.""  Later on, Foleee lived through the eternal artistic conflict between his all-consuming passion and his pursuit of a stable career. He convinced himself that drawing was a childish activity, not one that he could carry with him as an adult.""I felt like drawing was a kid thing. And so when I stopped being a kid I said, okay, no more drawing for me'."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:896px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""896px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62b1918ec50719a89cd80ae2_self%20portrait%20(OBJKT).jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" > <figcaption > A  <a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1N5iHkuTw5W6Xk847PW5ifui2j9SPzJPKV/0""> self-portrait </a>  of Foleee </figcaption></figure> Foleee says he simply""forgot about art"" after his stint at the workshop. The decision impacted him greatly, to an extent that he did not fully appreciate until many years later. As much as he had told himself that art had no place in his life anymore, a heavy sense of emptiness was left in its absence. It would be a decade before Foleee next seriously picked up the pencil, which Foleee describes as a dark time in his life, disconnected from his true self.  Eventually, he started to uncover just how much he needed art back in his life. Around the age of 24, after flirting with a career in engineering, Foleee finally connected the dots on what he needed to do. ""I started therapy and it kind of hit me. I thought, okay, I do want to do something with my life, and that has to be about what I love', [which] was drawing. I was like, okay, what can I do that resembles that?'""  A career in design helped Foleee rediscover the artist within himself. It was, in his own words,""an excuse to get back to drawing"" that let him create without the feeling he was wasting his time. At the same time, he began to get more exposure to digital artists - too many to name, lest he leave any out - whose work he fell in love with. Taken aback by how much a digital art piece could look like a traditional painting, he picked up the cheapest tablet he could find and started to draw. Before, Foleee had taken to drawing in charcoal and graphite, his portraits inhabiting the gradients of black and white. As a digital artist today - inspired by those digital artists who promoted him to pick up the stylus - Foleee counts Caravaggio as his ultimate inspiration; Raphael, Rembrandt, and John Singer Sargent are amongst the other masters from whose brushstrokes Foleee tries to learn every day.  NFTs first came onto Foleee's radar with the historic sale of Beeple's  Everydays: The First 5000 Days.  It wasn't his first brush with crypto, but like for so many artists, it represented a paradigm shift, a new opportunity for artists, the likes of which Foleee had long been searching for.""I remember reading about crypto a couple of years before that. I didn't quite understand it. But then with [the Everydays sale], I said, okay, maybe it's an opportunity for digital artists'. It wasn't really about the money, more about the community of people showing and appreciating digital art.""  Until that point, Foleee's art was both deeply personal and private. Becoming a designer may have lit the fire within him to return to portraits, but it hadn't yet led to him sharing his art with anyone. There were some half-hearted attempts to share his work previously, but the fear of failure ultimately restrained him from fully sharing his art.  ""For me, showing your art is pretty intimate. It was really hard for me to just stand there and say, okay, this is me, this is how I feel, this is what I feel'. Some friends didn't even know I did art until a couple of months ago because I was trying to hide it.""  But the desire for his art to be appreciated - augmented by the NFT art renaissance - ultimately persuaded Foleee to give it one last try.""I remember saying to my wife, this is my last shot. I'm gonna try this. If it doesn't work, I am going to forget about my art dream forever. I'm just gonna focus on my design career and forget about art. Probably I wouldn't have, but I felt like that at the time. And to be honest, I think it was my first day on Twitter when I realised 'okay, this is for me'.""  Much is said about how NFTs make it much easier for artists to share their work with people all over the world  "" and to be compensated for it. But what Foleee loves about the space is the communities that can be built on top of these global relationships, particularly with fellow artists and collectors. It is this, rather than going full-time as an artist, that has been life-changing for him - and the fact that he still has his day job provides for an empowering balance.""It's good and bad at the same time because of course, I would love to be a full-time artist. But on the other hand, I don't need the income so I don't really mind or care about, bear markets or the situation we're in right now because I have a paycheck at the end of the month.  ""I can focus on just creating, not thinking about the need to sell. I don't feel pressure to do something that sells. And for me, that's artistic freedom."" ",2353

His mission is to change that, change the perception of digital art, and showcase Nigerian art and culture to others around the world.

Yet, only halfway through 2022, he's been featured on OpenSea's Instagram, Twitter has purchased his work, and he's earnt a spot on the invite-only art platform, SuperRare.  Aged 21, Four is already an accomplished artist, leveraging strategy, diligence, and relationships as levers to develop his brand. On a macro-level, he believes humans share emotional experiences, but on a micro-level, his art communicates a different perspective; diversity, originality, and Nigerian culture.  The Nigerian-born artist discovered NFTs scrolling through OpenSea, analysing collections and artists. Collectibles were popular, but there was nothing from his home country that caught his attention.""I was intrigued not to find something from Nigerians. I thought about how I could be distinct in this space. As a Nigerian, we like to represent our culture. I wanted to showcase that.""  Four uses his artistic skills to advocate for representation  intentionally, he's taken on the responsibility to showcase Nigerian culture, stories, and traditions inherited from his ancestors.""Culture isn't something we can forgo. It is something that is given to us by our parents and teaches us morals. The  God of Now  collection is trying to teach people about what we believed in the past.

Though he points to these achievements as a""privilege,"" his success is the result of hard work and a genuine love for his craft. Digital art is a solution for Four, an outlet that puts him at ease and allows him to articulate his emotions.  Despite being a recognised artist in the space, Four perceives continued struggles on the horizon.""Unlike painting or photography, the world does not recognise digital art as legitimate art. We have to work really hard to be seen and do something distinct. I do believe it is impossible for humans to remain in one state, so eventually, digital art will be recognised.""  Digitial artists like <a href=""http://www.culture3.com/posts/mando-and-osf"" >OSF</a>, <a href=""https://www.culture3.com/posts/taya-ferdinand"">Taya Ferdinand</a>, and <a href=""https://www.culture3.com/posts/foleee"" >Foleee </a>are legitimising digital art and paving the way for upcoming artists to follow.

As the space grows, prominent artists appear who can soak attention away from smaller creators who struggle to be heard. Though bigger artists have capital, resources, and visibility, they may not use their influence to spotlight lesser-known creators.""The majority of artists like me are struggling to be seen. If I had more resources I would buy from the artists I know. I see how hard they are working and their level of dedication. This would be my starting point.""   ""Unlike painting or photography, the world does not recognise digital art as legitimate art.""    Four   Relative to collectibles, the artistic community is small. But this makes meeting people easier, and many artists, like <a href=""https://www.culture3.com/posts/C3"">C3</a>, have found that making friends is key to their long-term success. The key is to be involved in the conversation, and eventually, people engage and follow back. ""Normally, I like to study a potential collector. I like to try and communicate with them through their posts, so when they eventually follow me, I DM, thank them for following, and ask if it's okay to get to know them. If you are genuine, it's very easy. As a new artist coming in, you must be patient and consistent.

The Nigerian-inspired series visualises original stories from the gods, with cartoonish vibes, colourful art, and artefact details that draw attention to the collection's origin. Four wants to prompt people to see things from another perspective rather than iterating on previous depictions.   ""Culture isn't something we can forgo.""    Four   To this day, selling any of his pieces brings him intense joy and drives him to evolve and challenge himself.  ""I have to keep breaking barriers, pushing for the best. As an artist, I have grown in art, communication, giving advice, and helping new people. I have to be the solution because, like I said, to me, art  is  a solution. People should be able to share their problems, and I have an answer.""  Four's enthusiasm and optimism remind me of Gandhi's words:""be the change you want to see in the world."" When he reaches the peak of one mountain, he looks to the next, aiming higher than before. After being featured on OpenSea's Instagram, his next challenge was exhibiting on invite-only platforms, Foundation and SuperRare. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1022px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1022px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62d917e0021f6d66fb06cc8b_ivl19p0FgutFoiIYt7A7xydQafp-HNNnoEAyKjEwGob-MCgToMOwjeJ5DNX4PygiyrzoslYDvDW1a7WY6XaFX9NPohGYzqZsON4EijeB3LTm-H4AuWNbTCaqJhFXyrkeZFQeTtzH0mTrcD73s67gsQ.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://foundation.app/@TheFourIV/foundation/129601""> Aura </a> , by Four, from his WhatWeAre collection. </figcaption></figure> Previously, Foundation invitations were hard to come by,""you had to really grind."" Four uses the platform to tell personal stories from his life. Even his bio, ' We are The Four ', originates from the three school friends who pushed him to do NFTs. The Four' is a tribute to the friends who helped him on the journey. It is not a fleeting mention, but one branded across his entire online identity, telling the world that success does not exclusively come from talent but from the people who help you along the way.""I think if it was not for them pushing me, I don't think we'd be having this conversation.""  The Foundation collection looks like a collection of stills from an animated comic or film. As we talk more about the individual pieces, he shares that <a href=""https://foundation.app/@TheFourIV/foundation/126885""> 4 Years Past </a> represents when his mother passed. As a young boy only three years old,""I didn't really get to meet her in person, only seeing pictures. I watched my dad be a strong support system for all of us. I wanted to give the story a whole new vibe and show the world that through this particular piece, my dad is a hero.""  Four's work speaks volumes, and his passion floods across our video. As an artist, he never limits himself to a particular medium and often includes prose to accompany his pieces. Influenced heavily by musicians, he pays attention to every song he listens to for the life expressions that manifest through the lyrics. Using the same method, he views accompanying writing with digital art as""a marriage of talent from God.""  After Foundation, the next challenge was SuperRare. The invite-only platform curates talented artists and is notoriously difficult to join. Four shares a story about an artist who applied for six months, twice a month, and eventually gave up. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:948px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""948px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62d917dfceb2abf0e078be1c_D7WZxR_9zB5NuVdLlaOFkKZQg_fe45fbkh4Jm6KV-i5W0q7qZ9cCdPmQCQieaspYQVddzIjgo2CQ8WBrErr4bw1_IfXcSWAUp8F7euTq3nEM-yeON_ed4AHC5H9rBThU7vJ7uprTMQjNEiFb38jkZw.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/0x9438210b5a9cf86241d8ca89a2c7cef29b208502/betrayal-1""> Betrayal </a> , by Four, on SuperRare. </figcaption></figure> His collections on SuperRare are in stark contrast to his other works. Here, he plays with photography and creates a sense of signature using a scarf, an object he considers mysterious. Scarves are a common accessory in Nigeria, shared within families but worn by different women in their own style.""I want to use the scarf to tell different stories, ones to do with relationships, politics, and have a collection that stands the test of time.""  An artist should not be bound to the confinements of one medium, but at the same time, they need to consider that extreme changes in their style could leave collectors feeling uncomfortable and undermine their ability to form a clear identity. To this point, he believes he can navigate this challenge by having solid relationships with his collector base and communicating his consistent approach across styles and mediums. ""If in the next two or three years, my art is at the White House, my collectors will feel blessed to have collected any piece of my work. I've studied artists I look up to, and, to a reasonable degree, I see that when they get to a certain point, it doesn't matter what they've done in the past. Everything goes up in value. So to me, exploring and creating a legacy is a win for everyone.""  So after nine months and a string of accomplishments, what is his advice to new artists entering the space? Be patient, be consistent, love what you do, listen to the right people, and help others without the expectation of receiving support in return.  There is no singular answer as to how to become a recognised digital artist. Each individual has their own Lea Rose Emeryrnings and experiences. Uniquely, Four has recognised that along with his digital skills, the catalyst for his success is""people"". He understands the proverb,""if you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.""  Today, Four is on a path to achieve far greater things. He knows blockchain technology is life-changing, and he is part of a community of artists exploring its potential on the frontline. The distribution opportunity is enormous, and now it's about meeting the opportunity with hard work.""Today, we have more visibility, more transparency, more freedom, and advancement. I think it's a blessing and a privilege, and I'm absolutely honoured to be here during this innovation."" ",3541

But when I talk to people, that's not what they're excited about  "" they're excited about the art."" From payments to engagement, a new generation of streaming platforms are moving the web3 music industry forward. Clovis McEvoy surveys the ecosystem.",Mon Aug 08 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Music; Platforms; Applications,Clovis McEvoy," The challenge of how to deliver engaging, high-quality user experiences becomes ever more central as music NFTs continue to push into the mainstream. Building a robust and sustainable music culture means offering an experience that does not centre on users' wallets or trading volume, but on NFT music players, playlists, and personal collections that feel genuinely beautiful to interact with. Ultimately, this means a good streaming experience: the layer of web3 where these activities will be based.  As you might expect, web3 streaming looks decidedly and fundamentally different from its web2 ancestors  "" and this difference is most apparent in the economics; in how users discover and experience music; and in how longer-term engagement and fan relationships are built.  To understand how web3 is changing the streaming economy, it's instructive to first get a sense of what is broken in the old system. There's ample evidence that subscription streaming in web2 has been a race to the bottom, pushing down artist royalties down to as low <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-does-spotify-pay-per-stream"">$0.003 per stream</a> and favouring major label artists at the expense of every other musician.   Part of the problem stems from classifying streams as a sale (like an album sale) rather than a rental (like being played one the radio), and from the pro-rata' model used by the likes of Apple Music and Spotify, where subscription fees are bundled together and then paid out based on the total number of plays an artist gets globally. This cuts the connection between artist and fan, meaning that, regardless of who you actually listen to, the majority of your subscription fee will likely go to BTS and Beyonci©. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3360px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3360px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62f1289b7412302020f67644_Decent%201.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Decent's mission is to accelerate artists' growth and help them own their careers. </figcaption></figure> In 2021, the UK government estimated that musicians now need one million streams per month to earn a living wage, and that <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/music-creators-earnings-in-the-digital-era"">only 0.4% of artists</a> actually achieve this. At the same time that artist royalties fell off a cliff, revenue for the music industry as a whole <a href=""https://www.ifpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GMR2021_STATE_OF_THE_INDUSTRY.pdf"">rose by 54%</a> from 2014 to 2020. In short, there's lots of money around  "" it's just not finding its way into the pockets of musicians.   Despite this evidence, the UK's antitrust regulator (the Competition and Markets Authority), has, in what has been <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/26/u-k-antitrust-authority-sees-no-competition-concerns-in-music-streaming-industry/"">widely regarded</a> as a win for major labels and streaming platforms, decided not to pursue any further investigation or action to improve the country's royalty system, which is generally <a href=""https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/12/25/streaming-music-services-pay-2019/"">duplicated</a> with few tweaks across platforms worldwide.  Rather than wait for governments to level the old playing field, artists and builders are coming together to build a new one. For example, <a href=""https://www.sound.xyz/"">Sound</a> combines streaming with the mechanics of a marketplace. Artists can host listening parties' to promote new releases and fans can listen for free but are encouraged to support music they like through direct NFTs purchases, with 100% of sale profits remaining with the artist. Rather than financially supporting the platform through a subscription fee, the platform facilitates fans connecting and supporting the artists they care about. Sound artists have earnt over $3.3 million from fans (¬£2.7m), with almost <a href=""https://dune.com/0xnative/Sound-Music-NFTs"">11,000 tracks</a> published on the platform.  By comparison, <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/how-audius-is-turning-up-the-volume-in-web3-music"">Audius</a> focuses on the streaming experience, rather than the marketplace. Artists can display NFTs on their page and embed links to marketplaces like OpenSea, but monetisation is primarily achieved through artist investment in the platform itself, via their native $AUDIO token. Users and artists can purchase tokens directly, or earn them through making and sharing playlists, hitting the top weekly plays' list, or by participating in remix competitions. The underlying principle is that those who add value to the ecosystem gain a stake in the platform  "" which has <a href=""https://dune.com/queries/427614/815096"">60,000 users</a>  "" and should benefit from its future growth.  These are two distinct examples, but it's worth pointing out that there are many more. In comparison to the heavily consolidated web2 streaming market, where Spotify alone has captured <a href=""https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/music-subscriber-market-shares-q2-2021"">31% of all subscribers</a> worldwide, the current topography of web3 music streaming is notably diverse. Approaches like streaming royalty splits, resale royalties, and finder's fees for curators (amongst many more models) are all the subject of entrepreneurial experimentation in the space at the likes of <a href=""https://twitter.com/catalogworks"">Catalog</a>, <a href=""https://opus.audio/"">Opus</a>, and <a href=""https://info.emanate.live/"">Emanate</a>.  When it comes to the issue of continued engagement and relationship building, a platform like <a href=""https://beta.decent.xyz/"">Decent</a> shows how elements of the web2 streaming economy and NFT sales can be combined to let fans and musicians develop longer-term and deeper connections. Using the platform, artists can mint a track and allocate a percentage of future streaming royalties to fans who purchase the associated NFT, which fans can stake (commit not to sell their NFT) in exchange for further perks. Big artists are embracing the model: The Chainsmokers sold 1% of the royalties for their album <a href=""https://royal.io/editions/thechainsmokers-sofarsogood""> So Far So Good </a> to fans on the music platform Royal. ""Artists do not have the time to be responsible for community engagement,"" Decent co-founder, Charlie Durbin, tells Culture3.""So there has to be incentives for fans to build that community around the artist organically."" By creating the infrastructure for the""post-mint relationship between artists and fans,"" Charlie says the goal is to enable sustainable music careers within the web3 space build partially on an entirely new model.  ""Music NFTs are great because they enable you to monetise your recorded music far more significantly than the incumbent system allows, but more importantly, they let you engage your community in an interesting way. What we've seen is that artists' biggest fans really place a lot of value in holding a first edition NFT. It makes them feel closer to the artist and that engagement can be really powerful as they grow their career.""  The platform, whose name is inspired by web3's decentralised ethos and the organisation's purpose ""to be decent to artists"", is combining music streaming apparatus with many of the functions that a record label would traditionally provide  "" something that was a conscious decision for Charlie and the founding team.""When we set out to build, our mission was to provide artists an alternative route to the traditional label path,"" says Charlie. The platform realises this goal through NFT sales as a form of seed capital which helps artists get started and grow, and by offering""positive sum incentives that motivate fans to work on an artist's behalf in a way that can rival label resources.""  Then there are platforms whose primary focus is on improving how users discover and experience music on web3, going beyond the limits of a single chain. Aiming to unify the fragmented web3 media landscape by aggregating music NFTs into one simple hub, <a href=""https://dns.xyz/"">DNS</a> is a leading multi-chain music platform. Shokunin, the organisation's pseudonymous founder and CEO, has a refreshingly straightforward vision for what web3 streaming should offer: ""You should have a thing that finds all the music,"" he says simply.""When you find an artist you like, it shouldn't matter where they are: if they are on Ethereum or Polygon or Tezos, it shouldn't matter if they put their music on objkt or Zora. You should just be able to play it and, if you want, buy it. It should work on mobile, it should work on your desktop, there should be apps, it should work on whatever.""  Platforms like DNS are tackling what is arguably the central challenge facing web3 music  "" how to drive mainstream adoption. For Shokunin, part of the answer lies in making the space fun rather than financial.""NFT marketplaces really revolve around the idea of holding, or flipping, or doing all sorts of financial transactions around the NFT. But when I talk to people, that's not what they're excited about  "" they're excited about the art.""   ""When you find an artist you like, it shouldn't matter where they are.""    Shokunin, founder of DNS   Part of reframing web3 as a creative and cultural space means abstracting away much of the complexity that has characterised early development in web3, and instead giving users an easy to use and aesthetically engaging experience.""If you want people to enjoy web3,"" Shokunin says,""as opposed to just trading and investments, it needs to be as usable as web2; it has to be fun, and delightful, and have interesting content.""  Usability is one piece of the puzzle, the other is discoverability. The organic growth of web3 music has resulted in a number of siloed communities, which has been both a blessing and a bane. That these spaces have been able to evolve along separate lines is part of what gives the music produced its distinctive character and flavour. At the same time, as the number of music NFTs increases it becomes increasingly hard for listeners to navigate these siloes.  An entire generation has now come of age with near effortless discovery and playback being the norm; Spotify has over 70 million songs, Apple over 50 million. To truly compete, listening to web3 music shouldn't need to be a deep dive' but instead part of a person's casual listening habits. ""We need to have really good discovery mechanisms,"" says Shokunin.""The algorithms that exist at the moment are very focused on finding things that do a lot of trading  "" if you go on to marketplaces, they're very focused on the latest mints or the top selling thing for the past seven days. And that's it."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3360px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3360px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62f12916ebca29066279d520_DNS%204.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > DNS stands for decentralised NFT streaming. The multi-chain music platform wants to be the go-to hub for music across web3. </figcaption></figure> DNS tackles this paradigm by having a number of in-house curators, who seek out and promote music, not because a track may have a particularly high resale potential, but for the sake of the music.""We try to replicate more the experience of a music magazine,"" Shokunin says.""The user comes in and we're like hey, check out this band  "" they're doing lots of cool stuff that you didn't know about'."" As a result, the tracks on DNS' <a href=""https://dns.xyz/"">front page</a> range from hip-hop by <a href=""https://www.culture3.com/posts/jburn"">Jburn</a> to spoken word poetry from <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/laurence-fuller"">Laurence Fuller</a>.  There is a palpable excitement in web3 music that seems to remain consistent, even during the tumultuous highs and lows of the wider space. That unwavering optimism may stem, in part, from just how dynamic and fresh the ideas feel in comparison to the entrenched culture of the traditional music industry.""Music is ubiquitous in our lives,"" observes Charlie.""But it is a tiny and stagnant market by comparison to its impact. You would think the market would be clamouring for infrastructure upgrades and new monetisation tools.""  Young and emerging artists are migrating to web3 because they are sick of waiting for change to come from the top. The challenge now is to develop tools, techniques, and infrastructure that retain the best of the disparate approaches that web3 has nurtured whilst making the space accessible for a mainstream public. The push for user-friendly designs, engaging mechanics, innovative discovery models, and new economic models are all part of achieving that goal.  Mainstream adoption will not happen overnight but, in Shokunin's view, the time to start planning for it is now.""You need to do more than make current users happy, you need to start thinking about the bigger stuff, like, what's gonna bring in and excite those users who don't exist in the space yet? How can they discover the best content in web3, and experience it in the best way possible?""  ‚Äç ",3833

If early-day figures are anything to go by, it's not really a debate: GameStop has already overtaken Coinbase's NFT platform, but also looks set to build on an early trading frenzy to carve out its own space in NFTs. The video game retailer's NFT platform reached $1 million in trading volume within 24 hours, and overtook Coinbase the following day, when it quickly rose past <a href=""https://nft.gamestop.com/stats"" >$3 million</a>. Around $4 million has been traded on the platform since it launched three days ago.  MetaBoy, a collection of 10,000 animated and pixellated characters, is responsible for the early trading excitement, with over $1.3 million traded so far. Early trading frenzy saw the collection reach a floor price of <a href=""https://twitter.com/AStonedSquid/status/1547110238830182403"">0.33 eth</a>, though this has now cooled off across the platform, with the MetaBoy's floor falling to 0.15. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62d17d24c561b6bac194395e_0Pjzm81kaEIX9uzsMoa4taTkyGdzRXvj1Z1hambj51zj0POekjdTecPH3QjJPrkSITmzie2uNMrw25mXnoqMPZ7lSmVRrurzs4Ii_2DK87pbUJcJwkijOCzw72v718etcrF49EX9P66vMHpsXCI.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Trading has been concentrated in the  <a href=""https://nft.gamestop.com/stats""> top eight </a>  collections on GameStop's NFT platform, which have seen a cumulative $3 million in volume of the total ~$4 million traded so far. </figcaption></figure> NFT trader Nicholas""<a href=""https://twitter.com/SpeculatorArt"">Kix</a>"" Kneuper, who co-founded NFT game <a href=""https://cryptoraiders.xyz/"" >Crypto Raiders</a>, tells Culture3 that he is optimistic about the GameStop NFT marketplace.""Doing $1 million in volume in the first 24 hours is significant. GameStop's position in the marketplace presents a unique opportunity to onboard new users  "" especially gamers  "" to NFTs,"" he said. (GameStop did not respond to Culture3's request for comment.)  GameStop's NFT marketplace was a long time coming. The company first signalled its interest in NFTs when it <a href=""https://decrypt.co/66122/gamestop-seeks-analyst-trained-in-nfts-crypto-and-blockchain"">placed an ad</a> in April 2021 for a security analyst skilled in""blockchain, NFTs, and crypto.""

Although the marketplace's initial performance has been remarkable when compared to Coinbase, GameStop has other competitors in its sights. The lion's share of NFT trading occurs on OpenSea, which accounts for 63% of all Ethereum trading volume  "" likely even more when wash-trading on LooksRare, incentivised by token rewards on the platform, is <a href=""https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1491095670522257410"">excluded</a>.  Nonetheless, GameStop's NFT marketplace has several advantages. Built on the Layer 2 solution Loopring, GameStop's platform is cheaper and faster than OpenSea, which is built on the Ethereum mainnet (as well as other chains, like Solana), and augmented by protocols like Seaport, which the company adopted in June 2022.  By contrast, Loopring is one of the <a href=""https://l2fees.info"">most efficient</a> scaling solutions in the market. Network choice significantly impacts the user experience in terms of money spent on gas fees, as OpenSea's <a href=""https://twitter.com/dfinzer/status/1536771701941227520"">recent Seaport adoption</a> demonstrates, which will save customers 35% on gas fees and eliminate setup fees for new users.  Beyond gas, GameStop takes a cut for itself of <a href=""https://support.blockchain.gamestop.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408905851411-How-much-does-it-cost-to-sell-an-NFT-"">2.25%</a> on every NFT sale, no doubt priced to narrowly edge out OpenSea, which takes 2.5%, channelling Chris Dixon's favourite phrase""<a href=""https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1425645842552086532"" >your take rate is my opportunity</a>"".

Also in the minds of GameStop executives will be the retail traders and investors who propelled the company's shares from $17 to around $500 in early 2021 with an attempted short squeeze  "" and likely played a role behind the NFT platform's enormous initial success. The company's shares rose 22% on the news that an NFT platform was in the works, and in the run-up to the launch $GME has risen 15%, to $149.  GameStop is a natural fit for NFTs because many prominent NFT use-cases revolve around gaming, such as tokenising <a href=""https://engagedfamilygaming.com/videogames/video-game-definition-of-the-week-skins/"" >game skins</a>. Turning game skins into NFTs lets players own them, even outside the gaming ecosystem within which they were bought, such as in other games, metaverses, and marketplaces. Several gaming companies have experimented with NFTs, but the space has proved difficult to navigate amidst <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90718590/after-player-backlash-video-game-companies-are-quietly-scrapping-their-nft-plans"" >backlashes</a> from gamers resistant to monetisation by the back door, similar to the microtransactions and loot boxes that companies have introduced in the last decade.   ""I don't think they will try to compete with OpenSea.""    Nicholas Kneuper, co-founder of Crypto Raiders   But with its gaming heritage, GameStop finds itself in a unique position, trusted to pursue NFTs in a way that augments the experience of gamers, rather than simply trying to extract value. In that respect, the company has partnered with <a href=""https://immutablex.medium.com/gamestop-nft-marketplace-bringing-nft-gaming-collections-to-players-with-immutable-x-fa4415e0fbb4"" >Immutable X</a>, another Ethereum scaling solution designed specifically for NFT game assets. When integrated with Immutable X, the NFT marketplace will become gas-free and carbon-neutral, and the marketplace is already teasing 13 games planning to launch NFTs on the beta platform""soon"".  These include crypto-enabled games such as Illuvium, Gods Unchained, and Guild of Guardians. Perhaps the hope is that one day GameStop NFT will be the go-to place for NFT game assets, having launched a crypto wallet earlier this year geared towards NFT investors. But at the same time, GameStop executives will not have forgotten the lessons of Twitch and Discord, which both built their products and brand for gamers, who proved to be a strong community and engaged customer base that helped both companies subsequently go mainstream and dominate their categories.

Ganbrood on finding ultimate creative freedom with AI,ganbrood on finding ultimate creative freedom with ai,Wed Feb 15 2023 09:54:20,"From 3D tools to animation to photography, Bas Uterwijk worked in myriad digital mediums before discovering artificial intelligence. But the Dutch artist, better known as Ganbrood, has been making bizarre, in-depth universes with the technology ever since. He speaks to Nina Knaack Knaack about how AI removes the burden of perfectionism and how web3 has changed his life in the most unexpected ways.",Wed Feb 15 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Ai-2; The-Netherlands; Amsterdam-2,Nina Knaack," Bas Uterwijk has been using art as an outlet for as long as he can remember; the Dutchman drew fervently as a child and loved art history class in school. But, confronted by perfectionism, he found himself getting less and less joy from his creativity.""My ratios got in the way and I constantly felt I was coming up short,"" he explains. Instead, Bas found work making adverts for various companies, as well as creating models for natural history museums. By working on commissions, he felt less pressure to come up with something""new and special"" himself.  When 3D tools first swept into the world, bringing with them inspiring productions like  Toy Story  and  Jurassic Park , his curiosity sparked. Bas explored 3D graphics, before working as a freelance animator as soon as industry-quality software was available on his personal computer. Then, yearning for a connection to the finer arts that he had left behind, Bas found his way to photography, now telling stories through a single frame, rather than thousands. And with camera in hand, and the machine sharing the burden of perfectionism, he found solace in taking pictures. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1112px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1112px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63eccbdb6969fc52365f3443_Screenshot%202023-02-15%20at%2012.10.33.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://teia.art/objkt/739586"" > Sakura Menace </a> , by Ganbrood ""I simply love to tie shapes, colours, and imaginings together through the algorithms."" </figcaption></figure> That all changed however during the pandemic, when the documentary photography that he had made into a career came screeching to a halt. He suddenly needed to channel his creativity into other mediums, and turned towards artificial intelligence, specifically a type of general adversarial network (GAN) that was becoming increasingly popular amongst the group of artists and technologists with which Bas had associated himself throughout his career.  GANs are one of the most common tools used in the AI art world. Comprising two neural networks, one is trained on a sample of artworks, from which it tries to create its own piece; the other tries to distinguish whether the new piece is part of the body of artworks used in the training process, or not. The first neural network becomes better and better at fooling the second, while the second becomes increasingly better at detecting fakes. As a result, the artistic output eventually becomes good enough for serious artists to work with.   ""Web3 has changed my life in unexpected ways.""    Ganbrood   With GANs, as with photography, the artist and machine work together. Now creating with this new medium, Bas chose to work under a new moniker: Ganbrood, a word which derives from the idea of art being bred' or thought of' by GAN. Using these tools, he began to construct portraits of people who lived before the camera was invented  or who never existed at all.  Generating photographs of Napoleon and Jesus, Ganbrood quickly went viral on Instagram. But more importantly, this brought him into contact with other generative artists who prompted him to make yet another career switch.""I have changed jobs many times in my life,"" he smiles.""As soon as I am passionate about something, I just immerse myself."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:7680px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""7680px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63ecc5c2da8cd88e0f8b72b7_Sweet%20Heaven%2C%20Keep%20Me%20in%20Temper.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://teia.art/objkt/753893"" > Sweet Heaven, Keep me in Temper </a> , by Ganbrood ""I love to tie European influences like Art Nouveau together with Asian and Japanese art."" </figcaption></figure> As with photography, artificial intelligence gave Ganbrood a sense of creative freedom in virtue of its expansive parameters and randomness.""My art is still partly based on chance, because of the software and its algorithm,"" he explains. But this has been no hindrance to the Dutch artist; instead, he enjoys seeing the outcomes of different inputs, and creating hyper-realistic pictures that would have been impossible to capture with a camera. But beyond creating images of others, Ganbrood has found himself able to connect more with himself through his work. ""A portrait of someone else does not say much about me. As an artist, though, I want to try and tell everyone who I am."" Through his semi-abstract art, Ganbrood aims to tap into our associative imaginations.""I see my work as pseudo-figurative, since it lingers between abstraction and figuration. And that is exactly where the mind can wander freely, to make its own stories,"" he says.  Meandering in the world of generative art, Ganbrood saw other artists talking about NFTs more and more.""I thought that it could be way to earn a living from my work, but did not like the Ethereum blockchain because of the amount of electricity it needed."" At the time, the world's second largest blockchain used an energy-intensive proof-of-work' model to ensure its security.  Of course, Ethereum has since reduced its carbon footprint to <a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/"" >less than that of a typical global corporation</a>, but, by that point, Ganbrood had already reached <a href=""https://objkt.com/profile/ganbrood/created"" >Tezos</a>, which was amongst the first to solve the environmental demands of blockchain technology when it launched in 2018.""I dove right in,"" Ganbrood recalls, noting that his first mint was on Hic et Nunc in early 2021. ""Basically everything fell into place for me, creatively and professionally. I found a medium through which I could truly express myself, besides photography, and for which I was not depending on others,"" Ganbrood explains.""I simply love to tie shapes, colours, and imaginings together through the algorithms, and try to show how everything around us is always inexplicably connected.""  Looking at the amazingly bizarre work of Ganbrood, one is immediately intrigued. It is simply impossible not to be fascinated by what lies in front of you.""My goal is to let you rethink what you are actually seeing. For me, every piece of art or movie that I vividly remember are the ones where your own imagination is tapped into. Making strange, combined, generated images perfectly lends itself to this beautiful void of fantasy.""  Ganbrood's inspiration for his artificial intelligence input comes very naturally. In fact, only naturally.""If I am actively looking for inspiration, it will not come. New ideas just overtake me, like an angel whispering something in your ear. Then I am almost possessed and need to work on it immediately,"" he says.    ""The most important thing for me is that I like making it.""    Ganbrood   At the same time, there are certain themes that Ganbrood is continuously excited to explore and which recur throughout his work.""I repeatedly seek to relate classical mythology with modern fiction, and I love to tie European influences from the eighties together with Asian and Japanese art; Jugenstil, Art Nouveau, and nature in general...,"" he muses.  It is this unique blend that has made Ganbrood one of the most popular artists on Tezos.""At 54, I'm now finally truly enjoying myself,"" he explains.""Web3 has changed my life in unexpected ways and I am filled with gratitude to be here, standing amongst my fellow travellers in this journey.""  Indeed, across all those themes lies one constant: the fact that Ganbrood is, above all, making art for his own sake.""The most important thing for me is that I like making it. I am not working with the opinion of others in mind."" Although not unexpected from an artist who has pursued many different careers, Ganbrood is quick to add a caveat with some advice for artists:""In my view that is never the right way to create from, but I cannot deny that it feels incredibly pLea Rose Emerysant.""

The world's encyclopedia is known for a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_bias_on_Wikipedia"" >gender bias</a> against articles about women, and though wildly successful in sourcing information for free, leaves some important areas untapped, like emerging technologies, new organisations, or particularly niche or complex studies.

Companies can pay (with fiat) for tools that help them access Golden's information in more powerful ways.  Golden uses a burn-and-mint model that lets companies buy Golden tokens (with fiat) and convert them into credits that can be spent retrieving data from the platform at scale. Companies never have to think about any aspect of blockchain, including cryptocurrencies or digital wallets  "" normally a barrier to entry, particularly for enterprise clients.  Unlike Wikipedia, Golden has no notability requirement. This means that projects, people, and events which do not meet high standards for inclusion can be included, justified on the notion that these things are still part of human knowledge and experience. And unlike Wikipedia, Golden's data  "" once accepted as true by validators  "" is immutably stored onchain: Wikipedia could be deleted, Golden can't be. Jude's platform also adds new ways of displaying the data, such as through timelines and how it connects to other topics, whilst debates about the topic and contributors to it are easily viewable.  Transitioning from web2 to web3  With its core function of leveraging and compensating distributed contributions, Golden seems like an obvious blockchain use case, but that is not how things started in the first place. Instead, Golden started as a web2 experiment in Silicon Valley in 2017, <a href=""https://golden.com/wiki/Golden-5R#Funding-Rounds"">raising $20m</a> from top investors like Andreessen Horowitz, Balaji Srinivasan, and founders from Square, Scribd, and Airtable by 2020.  Things took a radical shift for Golden when, in the autumn of 2021, Golden identified blockchain as a tool that could help the company achieve its vision. As a result of the web3 shift,""a fair amount has changed in terms of approach to building the product,"" says Jude.""For 3 years, Golden was building the web2 attempt at superseding Wikipedia and only a small community was around to build it [in the hundreds],"" he <a href=""https://twitter.com/judegomila/status/1529865786768052227"" >tweeted</a> in May 2021.""We switched to [a] web3 protocol approach and there are now 12,000 people (and growing) entering data into the system as we speak."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/634eaccc492df44a69ff7f39_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(3).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > A demo of a Golden article about the company's Series A round, which raised $14.5m in 2020, following a $5m seed round in 2017. </figcaption></figure> Today, Golden has a sizable web3 community that provides frequent feedback and contributions, allowing for rapid iteration.""[Our] timelines now have also external pressure to move very quickly, as the community have great expectations for us,"" he explains, opening the door on just how much had to change to underlie his company's web3 pivot.""We have had to upskill in web3, hire in, and tune our thinking in architectural design. Security has also become a premium drive."" They raised a further $40m last October to see the shift through.  How Golden works  Knowledge graphs may sound like an alien concept to most people. But in practice, they are not too complex. Wikipedia and Golden are libraries of millions of articles, and every concept contained in each article is a tag to yet another article about that concept. For example, Van Gogh's Wikipedia article has tags to Western Art', oil paintings', and sunflowers', each linking to an article explaining that topic. If you imagine how you might draw this ecosystem, you would draw millions of articles, each connecting to each other, to form a knowledge graph.  This is all a knowledge graph is: a network of how different concepts relate to each other. Van Gogh's <a href=""https://golden.com/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh-ZXAXY/structured_data"" >page</a> on Golden illustrates some of these relationships: a person, a painter, who died at Auberge Ravoux. Knowledge graphs are created from these triples': [Van Gogh] [is] [a painter], or [Van Gogh] [painted] [Sunflowers]. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:911px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""911px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/634e70b9c7658416a2ad012c_mxQPjyC7LjFh9rUaTM01hriyViC7T23nKbpbXyT10ScwhpsLzl8x-ZX-MIdRfaucNXhRgURoeeA7FWXw5avOfjPC6NaXqEXKzh2ma4ZNQACD1EPi_nK8WSV-tSxIiPN3GettpUFibdsdgSj36myyHQ1Y5JdqkwbZ1BXFRpc3ZiYy6Ht-hkiY2FDLhw.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > A screenshot of VIncent van Gogh's page on Golden. </figcaption></figure> But who checks the validity of these triples? What stops someone from adding [Van Gogh] [is country] [Africa], which is patently incorrect? On Wikipedia, anybody can make an edit, though some edits may not be accepted by an editor. With claims stored immutably onchain, Golden aims to be more accurate from the very start, with a network of multiple editors (known as validators) who verify the accuracy of triples by casting votes before the edit can be displayed to others. When approved, the contributed triple is accepted as a fact and stored onchain forever.  The core mechanism through which Golden aims to incentivise contributions is though NFTs. Contributors have a form of ownership of the triples that they supply  "" or other assets, like images or references. These contributions will be free for browsing consumers, but contributors will profit whenever their triple is retrieved by Golden's corporate clients.  The model bears similarities to the Wikimedia Foundation's <a href=""https://enterprise.wikimedia.com/"" >commercial arm</a>, which has <a href=""https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wikimedia_Enterprise&diff=prev&oldid=21238196"" >raised concerns</a> in the Wikipedia community regarding a centralised bureaucracy profiting from volunteer labour. It's a situation that Golden plans to avoid with NFTs underpinning a recurring royalty structure to compensate contributors when commercial enterprises access their contributions.  Several attempts at Wikipedia alternatives have been made, of course, many of which have leant into similar blockchain tools. The most notable is Everipedia, though the for-profit company has struggled to gain traction. Unlike Everipedia, Golden's protocol-first approach opens up contributing and validating to everyone, with contributors earning tokens to govern and share the profits of the platform. ""Protocol governance ... allows for less shadowy decisions,"" Jude explains, arguing that""there seems to be scope for higher longevity and precision in web3."" His company is a bet on realising that opportunity, ultimately creating a community-owned encyclopedia economy, and a complete map of human knowledge. ",3167
"Hash, Bash, Cash: how change happens in web3",hash bash cash,Fri Dec 16 2022 16:26:48,"The collective aim of cryptocurrency began as a decentralised global currency. But on the road to becoming a multi-trillion dollar sector, what was once a small subculture has become a highly diverse ecosystem. Paul Dylan-Ennis explores the core principles that govern how change happens in web3.",Fri Dec 16 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Community-society,Blockchain; Cryptoculture; Cryptocurrency-2; Opinion,Paul," As a subculture, web3 has never been something that people have admired from the outside. But it wasn't long ago that, for those on the inside, cryptoculture represented something to be respected. The story goes like this: cryptoculture began as something special, bound by non-egotistical values and a shared love for what, originally, Satoshi Nakamoto had built. But as it became cooler', wealthier, and larger, it attracted those with no ambitions for the community  but plenty for themselves.  Over repeated market cycles, cryptoculture has become the realm of those who want to take, whilst offering nothing. Not only has this diluted the voices of those making genuine contributions, but it has replaced them with influencer-culture, status-seeking, and pump-and-dumps. This descent of cryptoculture is no accident. It is part of a more generalised amnesia about what crypto is supposed to be for.  Bitcoiners, the original subculture, have come to re-learn what they truly want: a decentralised global money. But they also tend to imagine that most web3 cultures have this exact same aim, which both instantly embeds animosity between Bitcoin and the rest of crypto, and casts widely divergent technologies like NFTs or DAOs into the same bucket.  The reality is that most web3 cultures, including Ethereum, are better understood as experimentations in organisation, often with smaller or different aims: rather than making a new type of money, they innovate new modes of organisation, finance, and culture. Re-discovering these core values is key to the survival of crypto as a culture. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/639cafde714635a915777456_blockchain.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Paul Dylan-Ennis argues that a ""generalised amnesia about what crypto is supposed to be for"" is responsible for a descent in cryptoculture. </figcaption></figure> Web3 Cultures   Culture is what a community assumes to be self-evident at 'a slice of time.' It is not meant as a cultural essence that people are naturally imbued with. Instead, culture is what its members assume to be self-evident right now, but is also always evolving, little by little.  A typical web3 culture consists of an  imaginary  (or imaginaries) and a  commons . Let's start with the first: imaginaries are how we see ourselves and others within a community. The celebrated philosopher Charles Taylor provides a <a href=""https://www.dukeupress.edu/modern-social-imaginaries"" >broad summary</a>:  In web3, we might say that a commitment to decentralisation is 'part of the imaginary'. We aim to live according to this ideal and expect others to at least try. The decentralisation concept forms the bedrock that allows us to collectively work together because we are all, in theory, striving to bring it about. Imaginaries are often imperfectly formed, even ambiguous, and we fall short of them all the time and ignore the contradictions, but they are what bind us in the last instance.  More specifically, an imaginary should include a set of goals: behavioural norms about how we should conduct ourselves, an agreed history (or lore), and a set of things to which we are opposed.  Bitcoin's current purpose is to be a form of digital gold, and it is expected that this should be achieved in a decentralised matter. Bound up in the works of the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, it possesses a distinctive history and an unmatched opposition to our existing fiat monetary system. Interestingly, the purpose has evolved over time. Originally Bitcoin was presented as an electronic cash with gold-like features, but this conception of Bitcoin has changed over time, now leaning more towards the gold motif than the cash.  Bitcoin's current purpose is to be a form of digital gold.  Ethereum's most commonly-stated purpose is similar but different: to be a neutral world computer. It is similar to Bitcoin in the expectation that this should be achieved in a decentralised way, but different in that it opposes the centralisation of web2, rather than the centralisation of the modern monetary system. And rather than having a history focused around Satoshi, Ethereum's history begins with its co-founder Vitalik Buterin, as well as the contributions of many other leading figures, like Tim Beiko or Danny Ryan. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/639cae50f9a451aec8a9790a_ethereum-1.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > The Ethereum blockchain records the canonical state of the 'world computer.' Paul Dylan-Ennis argues that understanding this fundamental ambition is critical to effecting change within the Ethereum subculture. </figcaption></figure> We can see these same features of aims, norms, history, and opposition in the small components of web3 culture. Aimed at empowering distributed online communities, DAOs are proposed as an alternative to hierarchical forms of organisations, which they oppose, and the accepted route to achieving this has evolved from methods that were purely algorithmic, before '<a href=""https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao"" >The DAO Hack</a>', to one that accepts more social involvement and individual discretion.  Similarly, the focus of decentralised finance is on a distributed financial system accessible for all, set out in opposition to traditional finance, whilst NFT culture is built around enabling creative ownership, originally in opposition to the traditional art world. The lore of these sub-subcultures' is rooted in their exploding popularity during the pandemic-prompted DeFi summer of 2020 and NFT autumn of 2021, respectively.  Hash, Bash, Cash  Cryptocultures can be mapped by their imaginaries, but they can also be usefully mapped by their shared commons: the places where they exist. When a web3 project needs to enact change, this change must flow through its technical (hash), social (bash), and financial (cash) spaces. These three spaces constitute  the commons . We can see how they manifest in practice by examining the Ethereum subculture.   Hash  refers to the technical dimension of a web3 project. It usually involves core infrastructure, such as a blockchain, smart contracts, and voting tools (like Snapshot). Web3 communities imbue onchain decisions with a true decisiveness because what happens onchain is as close to the truth as one can get: any verdict is cryptographically verifiable in virtue of its unique hash. In Ethereum's case, the technical dimension is the Ethereum blockchain, which records the canonical state of the 'world computer.'  Bash refers to the social dimension of a web3 project. It usually involves a set of community discussions outlets, such as Reddit, a Discord server, Twitter, or governance forums. The social space is the town hall where the community generates chatter about the latest drama, but also where the community bashes' out a consensus view. Functioning as an <a href=""https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1073191121996469"" >'eyes test'</a>, where individual convictions spark debates ad hoc, people slowly begin to gain a sense of the popularity of certain ideas. When these ideas gain a backing  qualitatively sensed, not quantitatively measured  they will often be formalised and put into proposals, such as Ethereum's Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) system.  Ethereum's most commonly-stated purpose is similar but different: to be a neutral world computer.   Cash  refers to the financial dimension of a web3 project. It typically concerns the relevant micro-economy impacting community members. It can be a native blockchain token (like Ether), a token built on another blockchain (like Uniswap is on Ethereum), or it might be the community treasury overseen by a DAO. As in the real world, economic concerns diminish during the good times, before becoming contentious in the bad times. In the case of Ethereum, the cash dimension relates to the management of the native currency Ether, but the Ether price also acts as a barometer for the overall financial health of the web3 ecosystem.  How Change Happens   Internal and external shocks to the system are routine in web3 cultures. Change, vOla Kalejayetility, and chaos are the norm. One of the biggest shocks came in 2020, courtesy of SushiSwap, the Ethereum-based token-swapping protocol. Originating in 2020 from an infamous 'vampire attack,' where SushiSwap forked the codebase of its established competitor UniSwap, but established an extra token to incentivise users to migrate their liquidity over to SushiSwap's liquidity pools.   In terms of its  imaginary , SushiSwap contains all the traits of a pure DeFi project: it allows for permissionless finance, its community believe that this is to be achieved in a decentralised manner, its lore is deeply rooted in the original 2020 DeFi summer, and it takes a populist stance against traditional financial institutions.  In terms of its  commons , SushiSwap is a smart contract protocol for exchanging tokens. It is run as a DAO through blockchain governance (hash), a community that organises itself on a dedicated Discord and Telegram with a governance forum (bash), and, finally, a community treasury (cash). It also provides a vivid case study of the importance of cryptocultural imaginaries and a shared commons at work.  Yet, SushiSwap almost collapsed before it even got going. Back in September 2020, its leader, known only by the pseudonym Chef Nomi, transferred $14 million worth of Ether from the SushiSwap 'developer fund' to a personal wallet. In this early era of DeFi culture, it was not uncommon for a founder to have unilateral power to do this. This is about as internal a shock as it gets: the founder has stolen the community treasury! <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1962px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1962px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/639f92d9caead86eb0b519c6_ezgifcom-gif-maker-(1)-IyhniPtxu-transformed.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > SushiSwap is a decentralised crypto exchange, launched in August 2020. Paul Dylan-Ennis argues that it provides a clear example of how change happens in web3. </figcaption></figure> How to enact the appropriate response in a decentralised web3 culture like SushiSwap? Response travels through the commons, but it ideally should not viOla Kalejayete the imaginary. The imaginary dictates the behavioural boundaries of what an acceptable response could be, and provides the community with the appropriate coordination mechanisms to act.  In SushiSwap's case, the job was to get the  cash  (the developer fund) back into the  hash  (an Ethereum wallet under the control of the community), but the difficulty lies in how much friction this path through the commons generates with the imaginary. This is the key to understanding how change happens in decentralised web3 cultures. In any subculture, too many sparks, too much conflict with the imaginary, grinds the response to a halt. Crypto is no different.  Web3 cultures do not become inert when faced with the lack of a technical solution.  The successful response within the SushiSwap community came from the  bash  part of the commons. The solution could not be technical because  per the DeFi imaginary  it is not possible to simply reverse the transaction through centralised mechanisms that should not exist. Instead, the community applied pressure where it could, socially.  The SushiSwap community first began to dig into the identity of Chef Nomi. This did not result in a clear answer, but made apparent to Chef Nomi that their life would become one of the fugitive, with the community constantly on their tail. This pressure caused Chef Nomi to transfer the money over to cryptocurrency exchange owner Sam Bankman-Fried (oh the irony!), who then helped migrate the funds over to a multisig wallet, restoring the old order. From  bash  to  hash .  This solution travelled through the commons frictionlessly because it did not viOla Kalejayete any of the core principles of the DeFi imaginary. Contrary to popular belief, web3 cultures do not become inert when faced with the lack of a technical solution or centralised tool. Instead, they are content to evoke social solutions so long as they are not in contradiction with their cultural beliefs. Or rather, their cultural imaginary.  ",3678

While some -augmented work can be seen as technical or simply an experiment in aesthetics, Henry's work, paired with quotes or snippets, keeps the human element alive, never losing the narrative as a sacrifice to the computer. In this way, he uses AI to reimagine or twist characters we already know, alongside inventing new ones. Classic books and figures make regular appearances   ""  stemming from  Moby Dick, Alice in Wonderland, Don Quixote, The Picture of Dorian Gray,  and others   ""  but they're reimagined with a surreal, often melancholy layer.

Protocols like the402, Glass, and Zora are working to change this.",Wed Aug 03 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Creator-Economy; Platforms,Ekin Genc," One of the defining aspects of web2 is the creator economy: digital natives producing content on anything that attracts an audience, and with that, opportunities for monetisation and the chance to make a living based on your craft.  The digital creator industry was only a niche side gig less than a decade ago. But as content creation has grown to be an indispensable part of the online experience, it has also taken a professional turn, with at least <a href=""https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-economy-stats/"" >2 million</a> content creators globally now earning six figures a year.  Yet these content creators remain at the mercy Big Tech social media companies like Alphabet and Meta, through which almost all of their traffic flows. The Silicon Valley companies own Google and YouTube, and Facebook and Instagram, respectively, and are commonly criticised for running the platforms without <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/5/17176834/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-democracy-governance-vote-failure"">meaningful input</a> from those creating content, while profiting from their work by taking a <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2022/05/05/creators-futuref-ads-tech-firms-newfronts"">huge cut</a> of advertising. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1708px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1708px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ea5ec1f905d00e23b9d9bf_zora.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Zora's  <a href=""https://zora.co/manifesto""> manifesto </a>  embodies the spirit behind the web3 creator economy. </figcaption></figure>""If Instagram or TikTok disappeared, as a creative who uses these channels to create content or share your work, you would you would lose what you built, your audience, and your work created on those platforms,"" Yana Sosnovskaya, Head of Marketing at the creator economy protocol <a href=""https://zora.co/"">Zora</a>, tells Culture3. That makes creators  "" and the revenue they generate  "" dependent on the platforms, who use their power to extract large portions of the revenue through high take rates.  Meta's Horizon Worlds metaverse claims a 47.5% take rate on all creator revenue, YouTube takes 45% of all advertising spend on creator videos, whilst only a handful of the biggest accounts on TikTok or Instagram receive anything at all, even though it's user-generated content that makes the social media apps attractive.   For many, this is not a bug, but a feature  "" a feature that underpins the web2 model, which lets creators essentially 'rent' space on platforms rather than own it. By contrast, web3 offers content creators an alternative model that is more suited to helping them pursue non-advertising revenue by building deeper relationships with their communities.  Developers are flooding in to make that happen. Ravi Bakhai wanted to build a protocol to""help those who provide beauty and value to the world, but repeatedly get the short end of the stick."" His solution is <a href=""https://mirror.xyz/0x5bd70C712D7499BaBACFdfFBc5EB73C88a23aeaE/nMVsZbjNb-vmkhEaYVgFyZqGsN1lgPOvhd9C1TsebHA"">the402</a>, a protocol that makes it easy for creators to earn a living from their craft. If we can build new systems to enable more creative freedom and sovereignty, then I think it's just a massive win.""  But protocols like his face an uphill battle when the core of the creator economy relies on network effects for content discovery, virality rather than community building, and also content moderation in the face of regulatory pressure.""I think in the mid-term web2 platforms will still be the way for mass distribution until there is a web3 alternative, but creators will be able to drive their engaged web2 audience into web3 and build a flywheel,"" he said, adding that he believes""traditional larger media platforms will have less overall control as creators have more optionality around monetisation and ownership of their fan graph.""  In its current form, the main differentiation in the web3 creator economy is tokenisation. <a href=""https://glass.xyz"">Glass</a>, another protocol, lets creators tokenise videos as NFTs and sell them to fans  or investors who believe they've found someone who's going to make it big. Tokenisation finds a middle ground between paywalls and resorting to advertising; the content is still available for everyone to enjoy, but a creator's biggest fans can use NFTs to gain access to a deeper community and, if the artist becomes successful, go on that journey with them and benefit from their early conviction.   ""Creators will be able to drive their engaged web2 audience into web3.""    Gabriel Haines, a crypto video creator   YouTube is one of the most popular sites in the world, but 97% of creators on the platform make <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/03/02/why-almost-no-one-is-making-a-living-on-youtube/#:~:text=means%20at%20least-,1%20video%20views,-%E2%80%94%20is%20worth%20only"" >under $12,000</a>, less than the US poverty line. That's generally taken to be anyone who receives fewer than 1 million views per month. Dayo Adeosun, founder of <a href=""https://glass.xyz"" >Glass</a>, argues that""video creators are faced today with either putting videos on social media and getting less than 2 cents per view, or going into debt to make a video that never breaks even.""  Dayo explains that Glass creators  can  make ten to a hundred times more with their videos compared to YouTube and TikTok. That's all contingent upon willing buyers, of course. It's not that web3 makes your videos more popular, it's that it gives the creator more options on how to distribute their content, and thus more of the upside when they succeed. Gabriel Haines, famous for his entertaining and exuberant crypto <a href=""https://twitter.com/gabrielhaines/media"">videos</a> on Twitter, alongside his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lImfnQHWoGg"" >educational</a> content on YouTube, made 0.05 eth from selling one of his <a href=""https://glass.xyz/v/mAnPKHyz9yq7CNyGSgoNLexz7HVO_V3CvNfeswir1pU=?curator=0xCFFE08BDf20918007f8Ab268C32f8756494fC8D8"">videos</a> through Glass. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1527px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1527px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ea6064eb8820eec6305bf9_gkass.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://glass.xyz/""> Glass </a> ' purpose is simple: video, owned by you. </figcaption></figure> That might not seem like a lot of money when compared to some of the sky-rocketing NFT sales, but the ambition of Glass is to help a large number of creators make a living, rather than helping a smaller group make millions. Even so, for Gabriel, 0.05 eth, which is about ¬£70 / $85, equals three months of his YouTube ad revenue. Despite hours spent on content creation, he tells Culture3 that""most of the value accrues to the social media company, (whereas) web3 allows an audience to support their favourite creators directly.""  A common criticism lobbed at web3 is that it <a href=""https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1438699940478398465"">financialises</a> everything, and the tagline that web3 can bolster creator revenue only strengthens that claim. But in reality, the internet was <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/02/future-internet-blockchain-investment-banking/621480/"" >already financialised</a>. The difference is that web3 makes this public, and gives more options in how you spend your assets, whilst web2 models are opaque and inflexible, hidden in the servers at Alphabet and Meta.  It is all at the experimental stage at the moment, and the web3 alternative is not a substitute for web2. On the contrary, it is a complement; it has to be, given that so much of the infrastructure still relies on web2 providers. Blockchains can easily accommodate textual data, like links to files, but storing anything above small-sized pixelated images on-chain is technically difficult.   ""Web3 allows an audience to support their favourite creators directly.""    Gabriel Haines   Decentralisation does not require on-chain storage, of course, and there are decentralised peer-to-peer file storage networks like Filecoin or Arweave. But they are often financially prohibitive. Hosting a 1gb video costs ¬£7 / $8.50 on the decentralised storage platform Arweave, according to <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/ArweaveFees/status/1466815960480841728"" >Arweave Fees</a>. Convenient though it may be, the current reliance on web2 for content storage is a fundamental problem in the long-run. Web2 runs on centralised servers, a single point of failure orthogonal to the purpose of decentralisation.   By giving you ownership of your content, your audience, and your fan graph, web3 can remove this dependency. Zora has a different perspective. As Yana puts it,  ""web3 provides creators with tools that allow for the transparent and direct ownership of the channels where they share their work with their audience."" Indeed, with tools like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/expanding-the-cosmos-an-introduction-to-layer-0"">Cosmos</a> built for the creation of application-specific blockchains, future creators could build their own community ecosystems, welcoming newcomers with""Hey guys, welcome to my chain!""  It might just take a bit of time. ",2731
How Adimverse is pushing the boundaries of story creation with web3 ,how adimverse is pushing the boundaries of creation with web3,Mon Feb 27 2023 15:50:15,"Adimverse is creating a new way of storytelling. Using creator rooms, they introduce a collaborative aspect to character creation. But what is truly special about their model is that they allow each and every contributor to hold IP rights, as well as to collect royalties.",Mon Feb 27 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Communities-built,Storytelling-Nfts; Collaborative-Creation; Intellectual-Property,Allen Taylor," Stories are powerful media. They help people make sense of the world, connect with others, and construct meaning for their lives. Through the sands of time, storytelling has evolved and culminated with blockchain technology in a variety of emerging forms. Web3 creators are bringing new stories to life in exciting ways.  It's difficult to pinpoint precisely when humans began to tell stories. Paintings in France's Chauvet Cave indicate that it could have been as long ago as<a href=""https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/france-chauvet-cave-makes-grand-debut-180954582/"" > 36,000 years</a> ago.  Writing  stories is also a tradition that is thousands of years old, established when The Sumerians gave us the<a href=""https://www.historyonthenet.com/the-epic-of-gilgamesh"" > Epic of Gilgamesh</a> approximately 3,000 years ago.  Before the advent of writing, oral storytelling dominated. From tales of  Budj Bim  to  The Iliad , oral stories prepared the way for transferring the collective memory into codified written narratives. Even now, oral storytelling hasn't gone out of fashion, as the growth of initiatives like <a href=""https://storycorps.org/about/"" >StoryCorps</a> and <a href=""https://www.ted.com/watch/tedx-talks"" >TedX</a> prove.  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2868px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2868px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63fcd8e8e4472cb5b60edeb7_adimvserse.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://adimverse.com/"" >  Adimverse </a>  is a web3 media company focused on collaborative character creation and community-owned storytelling. </figcaption></figure> From clay tablets to moving images, stories have been told through a variety of media; as new technologies emerge, storytelling techniques advance and mature. For example, the serial magazine fiction of the 19<sup >th</sup> century paved the way for the novel as a popular storytelling form. In the 20<sup >th</sup> century, silent movies morphed into""talkies"" and the internet gave birth to interactive literature.   More recently, the emergence of cryptocurrencies in the 21st has delivered new, decentralised methods of telling stories. One example is<a href=""https://adimverse.com/"" > Adimverse</a>, a web3 media company focused on collaborative character creation and community-owned storytelling.  Adimverse is the brainchild of actor Robert McElhenney, best known for his role in the black comedy series,  It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia . For this project, McElhenney enlisted the help of other co-founders, including writer Keyonna Taylor and Chief Community Officer Spencer Marell.  The concept is simple: creators join Adimverse and receive an NFT as proof of membership. Meeting in creator rooms, they collaborate on developing characters and, once completed, each participant in a room receives a non-transferrable NFT of their core character with details about ownership, governance, and royalty rights. The beauty of this process is that the holders of these character NFTs can then use those characters in commercial projects and every participant who contributed to their creation can benefit financially through royalties. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63fcd9b418da8515b7b05ed5_rob.webp"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Robert McElhenney, best known for his role in the black comedy series,  It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia  is one of the founders of Adimverse. </figcaption></figure> Still in its infancy, Adimverse launched with 100 creators from around the world to fill its first creator room early in 2022, and have opened several new rooms since. The Adim team is pushing the boundaries of story creation, using web3 tools, by facilitating character usage across genres, mediums, and IP rights holders.   In other words, the same character could appear as the protagonist in a romance novel, an antagonist in a fantasy role-playing video game, and a foil in a murder mystery streaming movie series. On the other side of the experiment, however, a universe of possibilities exists. While commercialisation of any character has yet to happen, Adimverse has already proven their worth as the facilitator of a new way to craft stories.  Adimverse is using blockchain to facilitate the collaborative process.  Thus far, Adimverse has created 43 different characters ranging from Bailey Oliver, a mail-stealing postal worker who believes that she lives in a simulation, to Pig the house cat, who is really a fallen goddess. Other colourful characters include Ted the Projectionist, a washed-up movie snob, plagued with Main Character Syndrome, who is relegated to ending his career as a cinema projectionists, as well as Cammy the extraterrestrial android on a mission to observe life on Earth.  Collaboration is nothing new. The film industry has used the collaborative storytelling model for more than a hundred years. What is innovative about Adimverse is the way that they are using technology to facilitate the collaborative process and turn creators into IP rights co-owners.  The ways this could impact the future of storytelling are legion. Imagine royalty sharing, for instance, taking place with new worlds, narrative devices, and plot points. For instance, what if J.R.R. Tolkien had co-created Middle Earth with a team of collaborators, where each one independently wrote their own stories within that world? Where each collaborator had the right to build out those stories into their own ecosystems? This arrangement could spell the death of fan fiction.  Concerning narrative devices, suppose a team of collaborators invented a storytelling medium that integrated blockchain technology, virtual reality, and non-transferrable NFTs? In the 1920s, Surrealist poets and artists played a game that allowed them to collaborate on their creations in an""assembly line"" fashion. Digital technologies could give birth to similar experiments that allow creators to collaborate and collect the rewards from their collective imaginations.  Storytelling has entered a new, collaborative phase. Adimverse is merely the beginning of this collective experiment. When it comes to telling stories, the possibilities are as vast as the known universe. Shakespeare may be the model of literary excellence for today's storytellers, but tomorrow's tropes may be predicated upon new paradigms that have yet to be discovered. ",1926
How America's biggest loyalty scheme is using NFTs to boost revenue from its biggest customers,how americas biggest loyalty programme is using nfts,Wed Feb 01 2023 13:47:59,"With 30 millions members, Starbucks' loyalty programme is one of the most successful in the world. Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg explains why the coffee giant is turning to NFTs for a programme that accounts for over 50% of its sales.
",Wed Feb 01 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Starbucks; Loyalty-Programmes; Use-Cases; Applications,Randy Ginsburg," Despite the fading NFT hype, the underlying merit of blockchain technology has not wavered. If anything, the business potential for NFTs and web3 technology is more apparent than it was twelve months ago.  As gimmicks and marketing cash grabs run their course, major brands are taking a more calculated and strategic approach to web3 in 2023: an approach that views digital assets not as a flash in the pan, but as a catalyst for deep connection and engagement with loyal customers.  Built on the Polygon blockchain, the Starbucks Odyssey loyalty programme is a shining example. First announced in September last year, Odyssey is an extension of the coffee chain's already massive Starbucks Rewards, which has almost <a href=""https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/starbucks-rewards-members-rise-despite-menu-price-increases/628746/"">30 million members</a> and has become a critical spoke in the chain's revenue machine; <a href=""https://www.pymnts.com/earnings/2022/starbucks-invests-new-rewards-loyalty-members-help-inflation-proof-brand/"" >53%</a> of the company's US revenue came from loyalty members in 2022. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1050px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1050px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63da6f4cb2d377b80f6af495_starb.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Starbucks plans to offer a more engaging experience for the 27 million members of its loyalty programme by creating a blockchain alternative. </figcaption></figure> Designed to offer its most loyal customers a more diverse set of rewards in a more engaging way, Odyssey engages customers through interactive activities called Journeys. Each Journey is crafted to educate customers about the history of coffee and of Starbucks, consisting of digital and in-person activities like taking a mobile quiz or going to a store to test out a new drink.  Once a Journey is complete, members will earn collectible Journey Stamps and Odyssey Points that can unlock three levels of further experiences, from virtual espresso martini-making classes to real-world trips to the Starbucks Hacienda Alsacia farm in Costa Rica.  Intentionally dropping the word NFT from most external marketing communications and allowing Stamps to be purchased with a credit card, Starbucks has thoughtfully designed Odyssey so customers never need to know that they are interacting with the blockchain.  Unlike other NFT loyalty programmes which operate siloed from the rest of a company's marketing efforts, Odyssey is also seamlessly integrated into Starbucks' existing programme, business goals, and internal processes. As well as being recorded on Odyssey, purchases are also recorded on a customer's existing Starbucks Rewards account, whilst for in-store purchases, customers simply have to scan their Rewards card to track their progress.  This makes for an organic avenue through which customers can be delighted digitally, and acknowledged for being part of Starbucks, strengthening their affinity for the product. In addition to expanding the strength of its membership programme, these initiatives will continue to drive revenue for Starbucks in both the short and long-term, encouraging customers to spend more with the brand than they normally would, and augmenting what loyalty programmes are designed to do: bring customers in for the long-term.  But in Odyssey, Starbucks has also embedded completely new features that their Rewards scheme lacks. Starbucks has since unveiled the Odyssey marketplace, where members can quickly buy more Stamps or sell their own, no crypto required. This leans into the core advantage of building in web3: your applications are interoperable with all the other data on the chain. Through the marketplace, customers can sell Stamps for cash, making coffee a drink-to-earn initiative backed by real value and rewards at the end of it. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63da621e624c0e2de74988cf_9Ee-WaklTEduwFWA8KgUQDgE_nyD5qP--ChWTJZuu0YbPF4SbNkNOGsGA4UKJPJOoSRjgC0qFo3vP8PPQeJygNksAN1elGfaLLqeLbtMnLwJgQzwzxBdcRhJuhLtSWYZquRb4Zz3CqBexUjkW1oPYuI.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Starbucks Odyssey is built to feel like a normal loyalty scheme, but it uses blockchain behind the scenes to create a better experience with extra features. </figcaption></figure> Starbucks could have built their own marketplace, but with Odyssey data stored publicly on the blockchain, Journey Stamps can be traded anywhere. Customers have already sold over $33,000 worth of Journey Stamps since December. It also means that other applications are able to privilege Starbucks customers based on their Odyssey progress without having to go through a corporate partnership process, which increases the value of joining Odyssey for customers and helps entrepreneurs build their business.  Rebecca Orlov is the CEO of Epic Playdate, a brand studio that helps companies create compelling visual narratives. She says that there is a lot for both web2 and web3 companies to learn from the rollout, particularly in the design and communication tactics of Starbucks' pre-launch strategy. Although the first Odyssey invites began in December, Starbucks opened a waitlist months earlier, while they were, in Rebecca's words,""still building the plane"". That helps build excitement for the launch, as well as ensuring that it gets off to a strong start.  By revealing their most interested consumers, the waitlist also gave Starbucks greater insight into Odyssey's likely users.""The Starbucks community is so massive, and a huge percentage is not even aware of web3, but they now have a defined cohort from these early sign-ups to use as a focus group,"" Orlov tells Culture3.""Starbucks can speak clearly to them because they are cognizant of their typical customer behavior. The beta users know that this is a work-in-progress and that they have the rare opportunity to shape the overall user experience.""  While Starbucks has yet to reveal the exact number of those who have already signed up on the waitlist, the Seattle-based company has said that demand""far exceeded expectations."" Early users have also raved about the experience, acknowledging that the gamified nature of the Journeys <a href=""https://www.geekwire.com/2022/i-just-earned-and-sold-my-first-starbucks-nft-how-it-works-how-much-i-made-and-what-i-learned/"" >turned</a> them from""an occasional Starbucks customer into a regular one.""   ""Many brands are missing the customer retention aspect.""    Rebecca Orlov   And whether members have been accepted into the beta or are still on the waiting list, Orlov praises Starbucks for communicating with those initial cohorts, updating them with clear instructions on how to play, collect, and get the most out of their Stamps. By incorporating gamification and personalised communication, Starbucks has created a sense of community and connection with their customers, ensuring that they remain engaged and invested. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1400px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1400px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63da621ee181b8868546f7c6_W4zkVq41BH-dPKNS4Ub1YypPYUPJZPZdHmsz3062X7TrrBpGFuQ_yTZdCuBMtob13IYtuGi037-mLioN_fm7CNgkRCF5wnFyWzEbIZSy02pOWTM3h48HukIuoL1TnyiLJgQdlGSNaG6WBlNTzSvbW1o.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Breaking down how the Odyssey Rewards scheme works: Customers complete Journeys to earn Stamps, which they can either sell on the marketplace or redeem for rewards.

They offered me something I want as a Starbucks drinker  coffee  and I was invited to play their Starbucks for Life' game while I waited,"" she explains, noting that she has since been accepted into the beta version.""The intersection of customer engagement and gamification did its job. It made me feel acknowledged and feel good. From such a large brand, this felt human.""  As for how blockchain-powered commerce will evolve down the line, Rebecca emphasises the need for brands to be adaptable, employ the best marketing practices, and put the customer experience first. ""The transaction and experience onchain is technically different but the consumer is the same"", she says.""Meet consumers where they are and always continue the customer journey experience no matter what transaction pathway you go down, whether that's in-store, online, or onchain.

By providing new avenues for tokenising and selling art, NFTs are building a new ecosystem, opening the door for artists to earn a living from their work and experience more creative freedom than ever before.",Wed Mar 01 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Nft; Digital-Art; Photography-2; Glitch-Art,Culture3," Throughout the ages, artists have struggled to receive fair compensation for their creative output, forced into competition with each other, even as they sought to find patrons for their craft. Across the world, blockchain has opened up the doors to a solution. For the first time in history, artists have been able to embrace the scale of the internet without surrendering large portions of their income to middlemen who hold the majority of the power in cultural spheres, without creating much culture themselves.  Rather than relying on a third party to represent them, such as a gallery or publisher, creators can now release unique digital tokens of their work that serve as non-fungible certificates of authenticity. By organising digitally, artists have found patrons without relying on others, and by cutting out these middlemen, artists can retain more of the value of their work and more control over how it is distributed. In turn, that new autonomy underlies new freedom, both financial and artistic.  Provenance and Authenticity  One of the key benefits of using NFTs is that they allow artists and collectors to verify the authenticity of their work on the blockchain. By resembling a digital certificate of authenticity, artists can ensure that, whilst the artwork itself could be copy and pasted, the certificate that states who it was produced by can never be copied. Artwork created with an NFT can never be counterfeited or duplicated. This newfound digital trust not only protects the artist's work from being counterfeited, but also empowers them to retain the value of their creations. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6315fe1144c1d233db31159c_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(2).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/wagmi-35773"" > WAGMI </a> , by Patrick Amadon. </figcaption></figure> An outcome of this is that digital art, as a medium, has become newly viable. Before, it was impossible for digital artists to sell their work in the same medium that it was made. Whilst a painter can sell their canvas, a digital artist could not, before, sell their work online; the purchased copy would be indistinguishable from a copy-and-pasted version; hence the proliferation of watermarks online, and the reduction of digital artist's work to prints.   ""No digital artist needs to be a starving artist.""     Patrick Amadon   NFTs effectively serve as a watermark without tarnishing the image  and one that cannot be <a href=""https://www.watermarkremover.io/"" >removed by artificial intelligence</a>. They let anyone instantly verify what is fake and what is original, and in doing so have opened up a wealth of opportunities for digital artists of all forms, from glitch artists like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/patrick-amadon"" >Patrick Amadon</a> to the National Geographic photographer <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/dilek"" >Dilek Uyar</a>. As Patrick tells us:""No digital artist needs to be a starving artist.""  Ownership   NFTs represent a revolution in the way that artists can claim and transfer ownership of their digital creations. By storing and verifying the authenticity of their work digitally, artists can now access the other benefits of the internet, including easily transferring ownership of their artwork anywhere around the world. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1110px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1110px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63ff3ef12c3a7c442fc20c46_Screenshot%202023-03-01%20at%2012.02.20.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1VTaKud8PnviihT7xzwn7FvrXdV3GCEWYF/26"" > self destruct </a> , by Joanna. </figcaption></figure> This transfer is made seamless by the blockchain, which in no small part eliminates the role of galleries, auction houses, or others who might engage in transporting art, which can represent a significant extra cost for physical art pieces.  As a consequence, we are seeing blockchain provide opportunities to artists no matter where they are in the world. Some of the most respected artists in web3 herald from areas of conflict or oppression, but NFTs have given them the opportunity to create and earn a living from their art on the same terms as everyone else.  Speaking from the West Indian cult of which she is a member, <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/joanna"" >Joanna</a> tells us,""We were so brainwashed and isolated from the world that any act of freedom was seen as a disgrace. Web3 opened up an avenue that I could never have imagined. NFTs saved me.""  Fair Pricing   One of the most significant advantages that NFTs offer to artists is the ability to set their own pricing for their work. Unlike traditional art marketplaces, where galleries often set the price or take a significant cut, NFTs, and the digital ownership that they entail, empower artists to set their own prices for their work without any third-party interference.   This newfound autonomy and control over pricing, previously reserved for only the most established artists, not only ensures that creators receive fair compensation for their work, but also empowers them to build and nurture a loyal collector base that values their art.  Moreover, by storing certificates of authenticity publicly on the blockchain (for anyone to verify), they provide transparency to the pricing of an artwork, letting buyers and collectors evaluate the true value of a piece based on its price history. The combination of fair pricing and transparent transactions is a significant step forwards in empowering artists to take control of their financial future and improving the art market writ large.  Revenue Streams   The advent of web3 has unlocked unprecedented possibilities for artists to generate innovative revenue streams for their work. By leveraging NFTs, artists can create new business models that were previously impossible. Subscription services for digital art, for example, offer patrons, collectors, and other members of an artist's community the chance to access exclusive content. This serves not only to diversify an artist's income, but also contributes to a more sustainable and interesting art ecosystem.   ""Artists and collectors are collaborating in new and fun ways.""     Zach Lipp   Further, artists can use NFTs to create limited-edition pieces or open editions, both of which can introduce an artist to new collectors at a more accessible price point. <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/after-collecting-1000-nfts-zach-lipp-explains-what-makes-photographers-stand-out"" >Zach Lipp</a> has collected almost 1,000 artworks as NFTs over the past few years. Speaking on our <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/podcasts"" >podcast</a>, the American photographer outlines two benefits to editions: the potential for collectors to explore more artists at scale, because the work is more accessibly priced, with the added value that this brings to artists.""Artists are finding new traction in the space by making their art more accessible. Artists and collectors are collaborating in new and fun ways.""  Creative Freedom   Finally, creating art as NFTs empowers artists to express themselves, in virtue of building direct connections with collectors, rather than through third-parties. This new freedom fosters creativity, innovation, and experimentation, even for established artists. The crypto art ecosystem blends art from political artists like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/c3"" >C3naaX</a> to experienced professionals, including <a href=""http://culture3.xyz/posts/brandon"" >Brandon Mighty</a> (former animator at Netflix and Nickelodeon), <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/marc-simonetti"" >Marc Simonetti</a> (Game of Thrones and Disney illustrator), and <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/henry-daubrez"" >Henry Daubrez</a> (a web design executive). <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63ff3c6c40f43d2b7bd44066_day%20zero.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/0xca4607aad52f654cf6357895c397094c077a3236/day-zero-at-noun-rock-4""><em>Day Zero at Noun Rock </a><em>, by Brandon Mighty. </figcaption></figure> NFTs have allowed Marc to draw a line between commissioned art' that he is paid for, and fine art' for which he can earn an income in web3. He says that he is inspired by a quote from his friend, Sylvain Desprez:""If it's a commission, you're not a true artist."" Web3 lets creators move beyond the commission.   ""I wanted to do a traditional gallery, but it never went anywhere.""     Brandon Mighty    Meanwhile, for Brandon, some of his most popular artworks have been collections that would never have been approved in his day job or a traditional gallery.""I've taken bite-sized things too strange to pursue in animation or books and have been able to put them out there as their own small collection."" He is talking about his early NFT series,  Balls , a series of various objects and other creatures squished together in a round collective with a lovable charm.""I wanted to do a traditional gallery, but it never went anywhere. Once NFTs came into the picture, it let me open that idea from the vault.""  Overall, web3 is revolutionising the way that art is created, shared, and owned. By providing artists with the tools to create digital art, tokenise their work, and share it in a secure and censorship-free environment, NFTs are helping to create a new art ecosystem; an art ecosystem that will open the door for artists to earn a living from their work and experience more creative freedom than ever before.

How Audius is turning up the volume in web3 music ,how audius is turning up the volume in web3 music,Mon Feb 06 2023 18:00:36,"CEO and co-founder of Audius, Roneil Rumberg is building a music streaming platform that connects artists and fans directly.

That is the first three-letter acronym one hears when meeting Roneil Rumberg, founder of <a href=""https://audius.co/"" >Audius</a>, one of the biggest music platforms in web3. Not NFT, and not DAO.  Instead, electronic dance music is at the top of this soft-spoken founder's mind. A long-term fan of the genre, Rumberg now helms a streaming platform utilised by millions of   fans and artists worldwide. ""My co-founder and I have been dance music fans since 2011,"" says Rumberg, referring to Audius' Chief Product Officer, Forrest Browning.""Our university friend group were regulars in the club scene in San Francisco.""  Rumberg explains how, between shows, he and his friends would take to SoundCloud and Spotify to follow up on their favourite new artists.""We kept running into walls when it came to discovering music and recognising artists. Incentives were completely one-sided, in favour of the platforms,"" he recalls. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:900px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""900px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63e147ce3af64a07887fc816_dance.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Hosting a community of over 7 million musicians and listeners, Audius retains a strong connection with its EDM roots. </figcaption></figure> What is more, just 12% of the music industry's $43 billion annual revenue heads towards artists directly. Most painful, however, Rumberg says, is that""there was no sense of community being built.""  It was a perfect use case for the decentralisation that gives web3 its value  but critically, as a means, not an end. In the years since founding Audius in 2018, Rumberg, Browning, and their now 30-person team have created a community of over 7 million musicians and listeners, retaining a strong connection with its EDM roots; 45%   of music on the platform stems from this genre, followed by hip-hop.  The goal, Rumberg notes, is not to upstage incumbents like Spotify with the blockchain. His objective is to connect listeners directly with artists, without forcing them to be at the mercy of overbearing intermediaries. Web3 just happens to be the most effective way to get this done.   ""Incentives were completely one-sided.""    Roneil Rumberg   For musicians and fans alike, how it works is not too complex. When artists upload music to Audius, their content is not tethered to the platform as it would be with, say, Spotify. Instead, it is stored with the <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/decentralised-storage"" >decentralised storage protocol IPFS</a>, such that no single intermediary holds custody of the asset. Indeed, everything from artists' music to their follower counts is hosted and operated by the community, rather than servers that Audius itself controls.  In turn, Audius becomes a platform where fans and artists can freely interact. Not only is it free from the traditional monopoly when it comes to setting the platform's rules  the community sets those , but it provides the functional tools needed for fans and artists to cultivate relationships more directly than through traditional channels. ""We knew when building the first version of Audius that our product had to be accessible to bring in as broad an audience as possible,"" Rumberg explains.""The first problem to tackle was identity  how would users manage the keys that they would need to interact with the network?"" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1396px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1396px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63e14ede228511f2898e1513_Screenshot%202023-02-06%20at%2019.02.14.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Audius' investors include bold-faced names such as The Chainsmokers, Steve Aoki, Lil Nas X, Katy Perry, and Jason Derulo. </figcaption></figure> For context, because most patrons of blockchain applications hold onto their content directly, rather than delegating ownership and storage to third parties, they typically have to manage those assets with a virtual wallet and use a complex alphanumeric or seed phrase key to unlock it. But Rumberg says that such a solution was not acceptable for Audius. ""No solution available met the usability requirements we had,"" Rumberg explains.""So we designed Hedgehog, a non-custodial crypto wallet secured by a username and password.""  Rumberg credits this decision as being particularly critical to broadening Audius' user base: fewer than 10% of its users today arrive with a crypto wallet already set up.  From a general market perspective, tastemakers have taken notice. Audius' investors include bold-faced names such as The Chainsmokers, Steve Aoki, Lil Nas X, Katy Perry, and Jason Derulo, all of whom Rumberg hopes will significantly further the app's credentials beyond indie artists and their fans.  That is not to say it has been all smooth sailing. In June 2022, attackers exploited a vulnerability in Audius' network governance to steal the equivalent of $6m from its community coffers, a shared pool of funds used to manage shared back-end infrastructure.  Moving into 2023, the value of Audius' native cryptocurrency, $AUDIO, which users can use to reward artists and vote on governance decisions, is also yet to bounce back from anaemic levels, although, it can still boast that it hit a milestone this year by gaining a listing on Coinbase. Like all crypto, it remains subject to ongoing macro gyrations.  And while Audius' user base is enviable in the web3 ecosystem, it remains orders of magnitude away from the paying subscriber count at mainstream streamers, which work just fine for the average Taylor Swift aficionado.  Accordingly, Audius' ambitions for 2023 are abundant, including rolling out monetisation tooling.""Even if Spotify were to pay 100% of revenue to creators and rights-holders, an individual stream would be worth a measly $0.0057,"" Rumberg notes, suggesting that a fundamentally different model is required to sustain the modern creator economy.   ""It's time for digitally-native business models that increase value per fan interaction.""    Roneil Rumberg  ""Streaming bridged the music industry into the digital age in the 2000s and early 2010s, but it's time for digitally-native business models that increase value per fan interaction."" By giving artists direct access to their audiences and facilitating higher-value interactions, Rumberg's goal is for Audius to drive heightened creative experimentation when it comes to fan-facing offerings, moving beyond the""one-size-fits-all streaming"" of the 2010s.  This includes integrating and exploiting synergies with <a href=""https://www.soundstage.fm/"" >SoundStage.fm</a>, the Barcelona-based startup that Audius acquired in November 2022. A virtual concerts platform, SoundStage lets fans dance, interact, and socialise with artists in a high-fidelity video environment. For Rumberg,""it's a natural extension of what the Audius community is building.""  Absent from Rumberg's vision is unchecked growth:""It's trite but true that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Audius has come a long way, but it has much further to go. Our community is excited to tackle the challenges ahead and has been incredibly resilient to the ups and downs of the past few years."" ",2139
Expanding the Cosmos: an introduction to Layer 0,how cosmos internet of blockchains can help web3 scale,Tue Aug 02 2022 21:20:14,"How Layer 0 solutions like Cosmos are creating a decentralised 'Internet of Blockchains'. Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg explains how, in doing so, Cosmos can create a blockchain ecosystem that could scale to power the entire world.",Tue Aug 02 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Multi-Chain; Blockchain; Cosmos; Infrastructure,Randy Ginsburg," Despite major progress in blockchain innovation over the last decade, most major Layer 1 blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum still face fundamental issues around scalability, usability, and sovereignty. Layer Zero solutions like Cosmos are aiming to change the way blockchains are developed and operated, and thus help Layer 1s like Ethereum tackle these issues.  With Ethereum still operating under the proof-of-work consensus, all Ethereum decentralised applications (dApps) are competing for limited space on the blockchain. This results in slow throughput rates (15 transactions per second) and significant network congestion, which in turn leads to higher gas fees. Furthermore, Ethereum, like all Layer 1s, is unable to communicate with other blockchains without the use of cross-chain bridges, whose efficiency acts as a bottleneck on a multi-chain web3 future.  Meanwhile, since the <a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/"" >Ethereum Virtual Machine </a>(EVM) is a sandbox built to broadly accommodate all use cases, it offers developers very little flexibility for specific application functions, design, and efficiency. Among other technical shortcomings, Ethereum developers are limited to a few programming languages like Solidity and Serpent and cannot implement automatic execution of code.  Further, Ethereum dApps are dependent on the Ethereum platform itself, which governs the EVM. From fixing otherwise fatal bugs to simply adding a new feature, all changes must run through the Ethereum governance protocol before they ship, and the bottlenecks in this process are ironically counterproductive to everything that Web3 is aiming to achieve in decentralisation and ownership.  To combat these issues, organisations like <a href=""https://v1.cosmos.network/intro"" >Cosmos</a> are aiming to create a decentralised network of independent parallel blockchains each powered by BFT consensus algorithms like <a href=""https://docs.tendermint.com/master/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html"" >Tendermint.</a> (Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithms ensure that a chain can still operate securely even if a minority of the participating nodes fail.) The end goal is to create a decentralised network of interconnected blockchains capable of quickly processing transactions, maintaining sovereignty, and communicating with one another through the <a href=""https://docs.tendermint.com/master/spec/abci/"" >Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI)</a>, an interface that connects each application to Tendermint.  At its core, Cosmos represents a completely new way to create Layer 1s, with interoperability inherently built in. All Layer 1 blockchains can be divided into three layers: an Application aspect, responsible for processing transactions; a consensus aspect, through which nodes can agree on the current state of the ledger used by a specific chain; and a networking aspect, which facilitates the communication of transaction and consensus-related messages.  Until now, building a blockchain required building all three layers from the ground up. Not only is this incredibly time-consuming, but it also requires a significant amount of technical know-how. And while Ethereum simplified the development of decentralised applications by allowing the deployment of smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the development of blockchains themselves has still remained complex. Prior to Layer Zero solutions, developers either had to fork the codebase of an existing blockchain or build an  entirely new  blockchain from scratch.  How it works   Instead of relying on dApps built on top of Ethereum's virtual machine application layer, Cosmos uses Tendermint to facilitate the development of a separate blockchain dedicated to the application itself. Now, developers only need to define the transaction types and state transition functions needed for the blockchain to serve specific applications. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:36%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""36%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62e98cf5d6b0cae9d73310bf_rAcnjoDbc9SLIpx91FVIYX-0MIun7QkMFM0sTcDy6Fq35RVaDlVzUjXlgyzX-n5EksOQse_SnOkwnvDh0Vluos4K21w5BLdvnP0uNYTYeokZeOZAEG6AM7x_Vj12kqCpzW-ckh7V1ttWi2MIKoovYvU.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> </figure> Created by Jae Kwon in 2014, Tendermint makes blockchain development easy by packaging the networking and consensus layers of a blockchain into a generic engine suitable for both public and private blockchains. With the networking and consensus layers completed and accounted for, developers can focus their time and effort solely on the development of scalable and secure applications by using the Cosmos software development kit, an ecosystem of pre-coded, customizable modules. When combined, cosmos lets developers build high-performance blockchains capable of handling thousands of transactions per second and dedicated to their specific use case.  Once these application-specific blockchains are created, they can be connected to permit the flow of data between each chain, enabling public and private heterogeneous blockchains with different applications and validator sets to all function interoperably. These independent application-specific blockchains can be further connected through scaling solutions to create an 'internet of blockchains' capable of transferring value and data beyond the currently closed borders of specific chains.   The future of Application-Specific Blockchains   The application-specific blockchains that Cosmos makes simple come with significant advantages.  First, application-specific blockchains and broader blockchain networks like Cosmos are designed with scalability in mind. Whereas virtual machine blockchains like Ethereum run all smart contracts on the same virtual machine, application-specific blockchains no longer need to compete for shared resources.  This allows for significantly greater throughput and cheaper transactions than a Layer 1 blockchain. Take blockchain gaming for example. No current Web3 game is able to support the network traffic required to facilitate the number of concurrent microtransactions of a popular Web2 game. Imagine a future where every game, protocol, and dApp has its own extremely scalable blockchain dedicated to its operation. This is the future Cosmos is aiming to create. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:36%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""36%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62e98cf5e063bf7bc613222c_5G-_46ZVp1i27siAOXxYKYEog-ejwKmvvwUDNhxEWNlWYOsCNH89E7dkbLAkDAoo2MhqR944JwO3RrbvFJFkmck_Fe-hUsR_EjlK0Zr0e0o4uqR-qpZvtZfODjj9Rq_TPcsDUaNlHukZ7K2rLH4uxEw.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> </figure> Next, application-specific blockchains provide developers with far more flexibility. Without any virtual machine-imposed constraints, developers can choose which programming language, consensus mechanism, and development frameworks they want to use to build their application, and if a module from the Cosmos SDK doesn't have  exactly  what they need, they can customize the components as they see fit.  In addition, developers have far more meaningful ownership and sovereignty over the governance of their specific blockchain. Through this, they are afforded far broader abilities to tailor their chain for their specific application(s), such as deploying it as a public or private chain, and are able to implement changes with fewer bottlenecks.  Cosmos can be used with any consensus engine that implements the Application Blockchain Interface. Over time, we expect multiple SDKs to emerge, each built with varying architecture models and compatible with multiple consensus engines.  But for now, the premise of the Cosmos network lies as this: tackling core Ethereum bottlenecks of usability and scalability with the Cosmos SDK, which when combined with Tendermint allows  any developer  to create a blockchain dedicated to a single use case or dApp. These application-specific blockchains can then be connected to build a network of inter-connected blockchains capable of functioning faster and cheaper than any available alternative. That opens up an entire cosmos of beautiful opportunities. ",2410

While remote working became the norm for traditional companies, a novel form of organising gained more popularity in the niche corners of the internet: DAOs, known as decentralised autonomous organisations, are crypto-enabled online structures organised through flat hierarchy, democratic voting, full on-chain transparency, and a policy of open doors.  DAO enthusiasts often <a href=""https://twitter.com/shegenerates/status/1499450403267751937"" >joke</a> that a DAO is just""a group chat with a bank account,"" but DAOs can be anything that its contributors want it to be: a collective effort to <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/dao-raises-millions-in-eth-to-bid-on-copy-of-us-constitution.html"" >buy </a>the US Constitution, a group of creatives just <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/technology/friends-with-benefits-crypto-dao.html"" >vibing together</a>, or a <a href=""https://uniswap.org/governance"" >billion-dollar entity</a> that develops decentralised products used by hundreds of thousands.

John Paller, founder of <a href=""https://opolis.co"" >Opolis</a>, a digital employment collective that provides insurance and other benefits to DAO workers, describes existing corporate models of power and value accrual as the ""tragedy of the boardroom"": corporations rely on hierarchy""to extract value from customers, employees"" and""(public companies) are required  "" legally!

Governance tokens, another innovation of the DAO model, represent ownership of DAOs and entitle holders to the right to propose changes and vote on DAO matters, controlling its destiny. Governance tokens are also tradable on secondary markets with values subject to market forces, much like corporate shares, but owned by those who build the DAO.  Doo Wan Nam, Asia business development lead at lending protocol and decentralised stablecoin issuer <a href=""https://makerdao.com/en/"" >MakerDAO</a>, tells Culture3 that""the Maker community tries to align incentives with the contributors, so most of them, such as smart contract developers or business developers, have Maker token vesting as well."" This means that contributors cannot immediately sell their tokens when they are paid for their work, and thus only those who are willing to stick around choose to participate in the community. He added that Maker, like most DAOs, is open to newcomers. Even new and anonymous members have made valuable contributions, shaping the direction of the protocol.  Traditional organisations are charcaterised by myriad levels of gatekeeping, like diploma requirements, licenses, work experience, and often lengthy recruitment processes. In contrast, DAOs embody the meritocratic ideal: while the standard open-door policy removes barriers to entry, the pro-anonymity culture means that contributors are judged on the basis of their contribution rather than who they are.  Amplice, a pseudonymous contributor to composable leverage platform <a href=""https://gearbox.fi"" >Gearbox</a>, told Culture3 that one thing they""find extremely cool"" about how DAOs work is that there is no expectation for contributors to reveal their identity. Although some people may not care about this, they said, anecdotally there have been cases where people found this particular aspect of DAOs liberating. When you're pseudonymous,""you're judged solely on the quality of your work and nothing else,"" they said. ""DAOs are blind to race, gender, even qualifications. You could literally be a goat farmer with no formal education who lives in the middle of nowhere  "" as long as you have an internet connection and you have useful skills, in some cases, you get to compete on a level playing field with a Stanford grad living in Silicon Valley,"" Amplice said.""I think that's pretty dope."" They contribute to Gearbox as a promo video producer and receive token compensation in return for their work, like making a video for the GEAR Delegation Ceremony. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""56.206088992974244%"" data-rt-dimensions=""854:480"" data-page-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_avqfEwpQcQ""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/_avqfEwpQcQ"" title=""GEAR Delegation Ceremony""></iframe> </figure> ç  With the emphasis on flexibility and individual autonomy, the DAO work structure feels like the height of freelancing, particularly when there's a talent shortage in the space as their is right now and with no non-compete restrictions preventing contributors from working for other DAOs, unlike the similar restrictions issues by most large organisations.""I found this fascinating because I can choose to work on different things which equally excite me. But the main reason might still be lower competition and talent shortage,"" says Kydo, a pseudonymous contributor to <a href=""https://gitcoin.co"" >Gitcoin</a> and <a href=""https://llama.xyz"" >Llama</a>, said.  Although DAOs are open to everyone, they aren't for certain types of people.""At a traditional company, one might be used to having their roles and responsibilities laid out for them unless you are a C-suite executive. In a DAO, no one is telling you what to do, so it takes a strong personality to find their way,"" says Ellis Liu, a contributor to <a href=""https://indexcoop.com"" >Index Coop</a>.   ""You get to compete on a level playing field with a Stanford grad living in Silicon Valley.""    Amplice, a contributor to Gearbox  ""The concept of DAO still feels idealistic at the moment, but I'm excited to be part of the journey where we get to refine and shape this working model into one that is empowering and gives many more (people) the freedom to contribute their skills and strengths to a self-sustaining business model,"" she said.  Chaotic though they may be, DAOs are also relentlessly transparent; the culture of individual anonymity does not  "" cannot  "" translate into organisational secrecy. DAOs, in lockstep with much of web3 culture, have much emphasis on transparent reporting. All organisational updates, no matter how minor, will likely be made public. Discussions are usually held in public Discord servers or on custom-made public governance forums, with votes taken on public platforms like <a href=""https://snapshot.org/#/"" >Snapshot</a>. This all means that one can peek into how much a protocol's <a href=""https://twitter.com/0xtuba/status/1535458465338261504"" >contributors make</a>, <a href=""https://forum.makerdao.com"" >what they are currently debating</a>, or <a href=""https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0xa64ec8b446e509cb4b75092c4a714897790b70e2711fc3d6afa969c250e7eb92"" >who's voting for what</a>  "" and that they cannot lie about business information that is viewable on-chain.  For those who have seen the benefits of DAOs as a way to coordinate labour, the prototypical DAOs of today open up possibilities for a future world in which large private companies may evolve into DAO-like structures. ""Right now we're experimenting with these dynamics, but eventually a major function like a telecomm or airline company will realise it's more profitable to build loyalty into your product or service by way of making your customers your shareholders, and it will revolutionise how all companies are expected to conduct business,"" predicts <a href=""https://twitter.com/0xJoshuaSL"" target=""_blank"">0xjoshua</a>, a pseudonymous contributor to Opolis:""a non-violent market-based revolution.""

How DayAway is transforming luxury travel with NFTs,how dayaway is transforming luxury travel with nfts,Wed Feb 08 2023 10:29:53,"Hospitality loyalty programmes are often hindered by friction and fragmentation. DayAway aims to fix this by giving their holders access to a plethora of luxury hotels and experiences through a single membership. And with innovative email-based token-gating, members won't even need a crypto wallet to use it.",Wed Feb 08 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Hotels; Travel; Luxury; Exclusive; 10k-Communities; Platforms,Randy Ginsburg," Martha Waslen and her husband prepared their first pitch for DayAway in 2020, inspired by a longing to travel during the pandemic. Before any suggestion of the 2021 NFT boom, the pair had already envisioned using the technology to redefine what it means for people to travel the world. Two years into building the platform, their team is finally bringing this vision to life. And on a grander scale than they had ever imagined.  Birthed during the depths of the pandemic, DayAway puts a new spin on travel, tourism experiences, and luxury memberships. Most hotel experiences and traditional loyalty programmes from companies like American Express or the Ritz Carlton operate independently from each other, each with their own discount codes, rules, and regulations. And whilst private travel clubs offer discounts and upgrades at thousands of hotels, not only must booking be done through that third party, but it shuts out the hotels who are not partnered with the travel club. DayAway users can book a wide range of exclusive experiences at luxury hotels, including the highly coveted rooftop pool at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore.  </figcaption></figure> DayAway aims to eliminate these frictions, letting consumers receive exclusive benefits from a collection of hotels and experiences, gathering discounts and upgrades from multiple sectors under a single membership. Users can book a wide range of luxury experiences, ranging from private food and beverage tastings to access to the highly coveted rooftop pool at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore.  After validating their proof of concept following their launch in 2021, DayAway has now executed their long-planned switch to a web3 membership model. With two tiers of membership, one open to anyone for $500, and another priced at $2,500 and limited to 500 members, it is the latter of these that is the focus of DayAway's web3 initiative.   ""Their email address unlocks rewards beyond the DayAway marketplace.""  Martha Walsen, co-founder of DayAway   In contrast to a traditional membership programme, DayAway's most exclusive membership is signalled by an NFT, which provides holders with access to a range of further VIP benefits, like memberships at the adventure travel company <a href=""https://heli.life/"" >Heli</a> and the private travel club Little Emperors</a>, providing access to upgrades and discounts at 4,000 hotels globally.  At the heart of the platform lies DayAway's own email-powered token-gate technology. Similar to a standard token gate, where only certain holders can log-in' by connecting a wallet that holds a specific NFT, DayAway connects each token to an email address and lets members access their membership benefits simply by signing in with an email. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63e392dd2e43ae7d764072d6_Heli.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > DayAway's VIP benefits include memberships at  <a href=""https://heli.life/"" > Heli </a> , the luxury adventure travel company.  </figcaption></figure>""We mint a token for them, hold it in our custody, and link it to their email-backed DayAway account,"" Waslen explains. ""From then on, their email address, backed by our token, unlocks rewards across an entire spectrum of websites beyond the DayAway marketplace."" What that points to is a major advance in how the world can use NFTs: members can become holders of DayAway's Founder's Key NFT, and experience the benefits, without ever interacting with a token, blockchain, or a crypto wallet.  By affiliating token ownership with a member's email address, hotels and providers who integrate DayAway's technology into their systems will become empowered to verify DayAway members via their email, which Waslen explains will remove the need for those partners to worry about using the blockchain, or to worry about distributing personalised discount codes that might go astray.  Waslen contrasts the seamless promise of web3 with how users typically access American Express travel benefits in Singapore, where members receive a physical coupon book with discounts to redeem at hotels and spas. Having worked with luxury lifestyle brands for almost twenty years, she understands how the experience can be improved. ""Right now, redeeming travel experiences is very clunky. There's a lot of friction for the hotel to tackle in order to fulfil those kinds of rewards,"" she explains.""Instead of cardholders having to pick up the phone to call each provider, and each provider needing to cross-check this coupon code for expiration dates, the benefits can be validated automatically, right on the provider's website using the email-backed token gate.""  That applies beyond travel and hospitality and to every aspect of the consumer economy. For example, DayAway could integrate their technology into retailers' ecommerce stores, allowing users can create an account with their email to receive exclusive benefits like free shipping on the basis of their DayAway membership, and where those benefits could be changed instantly and frictionlessly. Hypothetically, this sort of technology would let Amazon Prime members verify their Prime membership to access benefits on platforms beyond Amazon's own websites.  But the impact of recording memberships as NFTs stretches far beyond the DayAway platform, or even the partners who can recognise a DayAway email address. NFT memberships are viewable by anyone on the blockchain, rather than being the private information of the travel club. For holders who do want to interact with the blockchain themselves, they can verify their DayAway membership to any other platform by connecting their wallet. In turn, this makes it easy for any provider to offer a benefit to DayAway members, without requiring DayAway's approval.  Those benefits will be on full display in 2023. Waslen plans to offer major web3 communities the chance to organise DayAway memberships for their thousands-strong holders, who will be able to access DayAway's platform based on their ownership of the community's NFT.  On the platform, they will have access to curated programming around major web3 events like NFT NYC, Token 2049, and Art Basel. DayAway will provide each community with discounts and upgrades on organised room blocks, along with IRL experiences at its hotel partners. In doing so, DayAway can seamlessly offer a taste of its services to target customers via the NFTs that those customers hold.  DayAway is just the start of how Waslen wants to use NFTs to redefine membership programmes, reduce friction, and open the door to further innovation and partnerships that providers may have previously thought not possible.""Before, you had one loyalty programme with this hotel group, one with this airline, with this retailer,"" Waslen says.""Using a token gate allows us to build a cross-vertical loyalty programme that hasn't existed before.""

One that is easy to access, rather than requiring users to download extra software; one where experiences are designed for each client, rather than carelessly flung into the same box. HSBC Metaverse Golf will no longer have Rabbids Lunar New Year on its doorstep (both genuine experiences available on The Sandbox this month).""Brands jumping into the metaverse quickly realised that the platforms they built on had no connection with their brand DNA or the quality and heritage they wanted to convey,"" explains Fiona Disegni, Director of Partnerships at Emperia.""And there was no ability to buy directly.""  By connecting e-commerce tools with Unity's Unreal Engine to create visual experiences that are actually appealing, Emperia lets brands build activations in extended reality that can have a meaningful impact on the bottom line.

On average, customers spend 14 minutes interacting with Emperia experiences, accessed via a browser   a massive increase compared to the industry average of just 3 minutes that HSBC Metaverse Golf will expect on The Sandbox. Additionally, the platform has shown a 30% return visitor rate and a remarkable 70% increase in conversion rates.  More important yet, it scales: the first step for brands entering the metaverse is to do the status quo, but better, rather than reinventing the wheel. Emperia's digital spaces, like a Swiss chalet for Ralph Lauren, can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection, with invitations to make a purchase distributed throughout the room.   ""We augment virtual and physical experiences, rather than replace them.""<br>    Fiona Disegni, Director of Partnerships, Emperia   Fiona tells me that what has made Emperia successful is their recognition that the metaverse is not meant to replace physical or virtual experiences  but rather serve as a bridge between the two. The aim is to""augment virtual and physical experiences rather than replace them.""   The company, which has offices in London and New York, sees its use of blockchain technology in the same way: supplementing the user experience rather than dominating it. This mentality is visible in their work with Lacoste. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1024px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1024px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6408d707163716139b1de539_image1.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >  Emperia found that using NFTs as a digital key had a high impact on driving traffic to the Lacoste website and stores with strong intent to purchase. </figcaption></figure> That work with the French luxury brand happened in December 2022, blending metaverse and the blockchain long after they had left the trend of popular vernacular.  Their virtual store includes spaces accessible only to Lacoste NFT holders, allowing them to purchase physical items not available to anyone else. The use case for token-gated commerce has already been embraced by Shopify, and Emperia found that using NFTs as a digital key had a high impact on driving traffic to the Lacoste website and stores with strong intent to purchase. ""Even people who don't understand NFTs can understand the concept of using a key to access a secret room,"" says Fiona.""If it weren't for that metaverse aspect, many of those people might have never come to the Lacoste website, let alone visit a physical Lacoste store.""<br>  The potential benefits of virtually-enhanced experiences extend beyond e-commerce. For example, digital art galleries can leverage this technology to engage visitors in ways that are impossible with a traditional webpage. By creating virtual galleries, not only can people view art that is situated at the other side of the world, but they can experience it in a more immersive way.  For organisations that already sell or exhibit online, transitioning to a digital store is essentially seamless, but Emperia is also looking to brands that embed narrative and storytelling into their customer experience to provide case studies about how digital environments can be used most effectively.""We're still in the educational phase,"" says Fiona.""Art galleries and similar environments help bridge that knowledge gap.""  With virtual reality technology and blockchain, beyond just exploring virtual exhibitions, there is also the potential for purchasing art through NFTs, which could be redeemed as physical art or retained as digital assets. Organisations like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/how-the-passage-is-redefining-what-it-means-to-buy-digital-art"" >Here &amp; Now</a> are already exploring what the metaverse can make possible for purchasing digital art, with the hope of making it an experience on par with, or better than, the traditional practice.  Emperia hopes that their approach to data will help them stand out from the other companies pitching to brands from the broad metaverse segment'. On metaverse platforms like The Sandbox and Decentraland, brands have little access to attendee data by default. Fiona explains that, by contrast, Emperia sees their offering as the beginning of a strategic trajectory for brands.   ""We try to shape the metaverse experience so that it is actionable for brands.""     Fiona Disegni, Director of Partnerships, Emperia   ""Brands have an Emperia dashboard where they can see, for example, how their engagement is, what visitors are doing, and what they interact with, so they can optimise over time."" She adds that the company also includes a CMS platform that enables brands to take ownership of their virtual world and keep content fresh.""We do the creative direction,"" she explains,""but the brand has the ability to switch, drag, and drop, the products, the SKUs, and media content.""  Carried away by excitement, the metaverse has escaped definition. Founded well before that excitement had even begun, in 2019, and fresh off the back of a $10M Series A in January 2023, Emperia plans to bring reality back into the conversation.""We try to shape the metaverse experience so that it is actionable for brands,"" Fiona explains.

How marketing DAOs are reinventing the web2 marketing agency,how marketing daos are reinventing the web2 marketing agency,Tue Feb 07 2023 15:33:17,"In search of more autonomy and earning power, the best marketers end up working for themselves. Marketing DAOs offer an innovative middle ground.

And for many marketing professionals, that provides a compelling value proposition.  In search of more freedom, autonomy, and earning power, marketing service DAOs can offer a desirable middle ground, making it easy for marketers to contribute autonomously to a collective and be compensated smoothly for the work that they do with other people around the world. In turn, this lets practitioners develop skills and augment their earning power as part of a group, whilst retaining their autonomy.  In a marketing DAO, all members can participate in the governance and financial upside of the community's continued success, proportional to the effort and value that they contribute. Whereas traditional agencies tend to have an operational hierarchy, service DAOs operate on a flat structure, with the incentives of every member being aligned through efficient payouts that reward work and referrals, as well as voting rights over a shared communal budget. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63e2784d4bebc74c53914883_DAO.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Service DAOs are doing away with hierarchy and centralisation in exchange for shared incentives and community collaboration.  </figcaption></figure> For clients, marketing DAOs function as an easier way to access a diverse pool of talent and perspectives: it is more akin to reaching hundreds of individual contractors than working with a hundred-strong agency.  While still early in their evolution, we have already begun to see these organisations make meaningful impact in web3 and, critically, beyond.  Driven by its mission to bridge the communication gap between emerging technology and the mainstream world, <a href=""https://www.storyguild.io/"" >Story Guild</a> (formerly known as YAP DAO) provides web3 clients with public relations, marketing, and communications support.  Marketing DAOs let practitioners develop skills and earning power as part of a group, whilst retaining their autonomy.   Initially founded in July 2021 by four members of YAP Global, an international PR agency servicing crypto clients, the DAO quickly built a team of more than 15 global contributors providing dozens of web3 projects with press releases and announcement distribution, media and podcast interviews, content writing, and copyediting. ""In a traditional agency setting, a PR professional's time is charged to the client at two to three times what they receive in their salary, and it is not unusual for them to work across between three and ten projects simultaneously,"" says Mia Grodsky, co-founder of Story Guild, speaking to Culture3.""In marketing DAOs, the people who do the work keep the majority of the fees, creating a better incentive mechanism to produce high-quality work."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2428px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2428px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63e27b0931e23e5ed9c2413d_Screenshot%202023-02-07%20at%2016.07.45.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >  Story Guild provides web3 clients with public relations, marketing, and communications support. </figcaption></figure> While the strategy and client-facing communication for the project is led by at least one senior DAO member, key tasks and deliverables are opened up to the rest of the community for their contributions.  All potential contributors must go through an application process called Pledging,' which entails a signing-on fee worth $250, similar in principle to partnership fees, but one that is returned upon leaving the DAO, on top of a cover letter. Once applications are submitted, current members then assess and vote on a prospect's acceptance, thus ensuring quality.   ""The people who do the work keep the majority of the fees, creating a better incentive mechanism to produce high-quality work.""    Mia Grodsky, co-founder of Story Guild   From there, the incentive model for contributors is simple: DAO contributors receive 90% of their revenue, with the remaining 10% is moved into a communal fund for operational expenses and to be invested in central services, allocated by the community. Story Guild operates under a results-based model where clients only pay for the quality of the results delivered, says Grodsky, noting that low-performing members are awarded with smaller amounts of payment in exchange for other members needing to pick up the slack.  But for service marketing DAOs to continue to evolve, Grodsky acknowledges the need for better DAO tooling, regulation, and legal structures. ""The main barrier for most service DAOs, and DAOs in general, is the ambiguous tax and legal structure. When teams start generating real revenue, they often need to consult lawyers and tax experts which is time-consuming, expensive, and full of grey areas,"" she explains.""Like crypto as a whole, regulation could potentially favour or create more barriers in order for these organisations to operate and thrive long-term."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:799px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""799px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63e27bba8c572aab349b9a06_myosin%202.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Myosin creates incentives for members to refer and complete client work within the DAO, helping to foster collaborative growth, as well as high-quality individual output.  </figcaption></figure> ç<a href=""https://www.myosin.xyz/"" >Myosin</a> is a marketing service DAO specialising in growth marketing and user acquisition. Describing itself as a""headless"" guild of growth marketers, creatives, and technologists, Myosin offers an array of services across three main buckets: finding product-market fit; accelerating growth; and jumping into web3.  For each project, 75% of the revenue goes to the project contributors, 15% to the DAO treasury, and 10% to the referrer. This creates incentives for members to refer and complete client work within the DAO, helping to foster collaborative growth, as well as high-quality individual output. Meanwhile, a minimal overhead is cut off to fund the DAO's central activities, creating a fund that the community collaboratively decides how to allocate.  Unlike other DAOs which anyone can join, Myosin works to ensure that only expert practitioners enter its community by carefully vetting and handpicking each applicant. The DAO has an acceptance rate of just 3%.  Once members are accepted, Myosin calculates a reputation score based on applicants' onchain activity, such as completing work or receiving feedback, to measure member efficacy and ensure a consistent quality of service. Similar to a Net Promoter Score, a key marketing metric that measures the customer experience of a brand, this onchain reputation score is based on feedback from both clients  and  DAO members.  After a member has completed five projects, the client-facing reputation scores are stored onchain, providing signals of quality that cannot be forged. Meanwhile, consecutive scores of seven or below from clients or a team member trigger a review and reinterview process from community moderators.  At the heart of the Myosin ecosystem sits the $MYOSIN governance token, which entitles members to participate in governance and access the benefits of membership, including educational resources, like templates and case studies; community benefits, like group chats on the token-gated Discord server; and earning opportunities, such as job postings and productivity tools. To gain access to a project, DAO members must burn, or pay, a certain amount of $MYOSIN tokens, the amount of which is ultimately dependent on the member's reputation score and their level of professional experience.  Marketing Service DAOs allow marketers to collaborate, retain their autonomy, and grow their earning potential.  The core value of Myosin as a service DAO is that it lets marketers access a community, which includes colleagues, opportunities, and tools, that augments the work that they could do on their own. In exchange, members give up to 15% of the income that they receive from any work that they refer to the DAO themselves, and 25% on work that they would not have had access to otherwise.  Beyond the 10% that encourages referrals, the rest of that revenue goes to funding the DAO's core operations, which is expected to create value that eventually feeds back to the members. For example, Myosin allocates a portion of its DAO treasury to build digital <a href=""https://whitepaper.myosin.xyz/dao/building-web3-growth-tools/myosin-ecosystem"" >growth tools and resources</a> to help accelerate the web3 ecosystem, such as web3 analytics to help marketers understand their audiences. For now, these tools are only available to DAO members and clients, but selling those services to drive more revenue for the DAO is also on the table.  Marketing Service DAOs offer a unique opportunity for marketers to collaborate, retain their autonomy, and grow their earning potential. They bring together a diverse pool of talent, with those included being compensated based on their effort and the value that they bring to the group. They are also well-positioned for a younger generation that increasingly values autonomy in their career. Whilst marketing DAOs may be held back by regulatory clarity, with DAOs like Story Guild and Myosin proving their worth, they could well become a mainstream alternative to traditional marketing agencies.

A case in point: despite the fallout from FTX's high-profile collapse in November, <a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/232"" >Ape #232</a> sold for just shy of $1 million later that month. Already this year, there have been multiple trades that have surpassed the 100 eth mark.  BAYC's creators, Yuga Labs, have <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221110006225/en/Yuga-Labs-Welcomes-Beeple%E2%80%99s-10KTF-and-WENEW-to-Their-Growing-NFT-and-Web3-Ecosystem"" >continued their expansionary agenda</a> in their acquisition of Wenew, whose partners include Wimbledon, Louis Vuitton, and 10KTF, a metaverse storefront, as they seek to connect multiple web3 brands under the same umbrella. Meanwhile, Dookey Dash, Yuga Lab's newest web3 activation, is the NFT sector's biggest news in 2023, even though fewer than 14,000 people are technically allowed to play it (you need a <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/sewerpass"" >Sewer Pass NFT</a>).  ç<a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/josh-ong"" >Josh Ong</a>, known as the godfather' in the Yacht Club for his contributions to them, traces much of the community's (so far) enduring popularity back to Yuga Lab's innovative approach to IP.""BAYC wasn't the first project to give commercial rights to holders,"" he says.""But I would argue it's one of the first where people really did something with it"".   ""It didn't just happen suddenly.""    Swickie   Across the broader NFT landscape, projects that grant commercial rights to holders continue to buck the trend. Fundamentally, NFTs are metadata  information  about  the data it is associated with  even if the data itself, whether art, ape, or other, isn't stored onchain itself. But owning an NFT is not the same thing as having full authority over it: unless the terms of a given project explicitly state otherwise, commercial ownership doesn't necessarily extend to the IP itself. Yuga Labs has recently come under fire in a report produced by <a href=""https://www.galaxy.com/research/insights/a-survey-of-nft-licenses-facts-and-fictions/"" >Galaxy Digital</a> for embedding""critical contradictions"" in its BAYC licensing, warning that holders risk their IP being""rugged at any time."" A similar criticism was made of Moonbirds, whose creators, PROOF, unilaterally moved the collection to a Creative Commons Zero licence in late 2022.  Yuga Labs, for what it's worth, have been at pains to emphasise <a href=""https://news.yuga.com/reflection-on-baycs-nft-license"" >their view</a> that, whilst""the copyright and the material object are separate and distinct property rights, a BAYC NFT gives you rights in both."" But their Yacht Club nonetheless finds itself in the middle of the rights spectrum. For where decentralised ownership  does  exist, as with<a href=""https://docs.doodles.app/terms-of-service"" > Doodles</a> or<a href=""https://www.cryptokitties.co/terms-of-use"" > CryptoKitties</a>, rights tend to either be restricted to personal use only, or include a cap on the amount of revenue that can be generated, by applying limited commercial use licensing. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1140px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1140px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63eb5857233e02669f64629e_Screenshot%202023-02-14%20at%2009.45.44.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > BAYC worked on a collaborative project with Adidas, NFT comic series Punks Comic, and cryptocurrency investor Gmoney. </figcaption></figure> While debate rages around which model of IP is best suited to spawn a web3-powered creative industry, the answer will come from practice, rather than theory. Josh recalls the creative frenzy which emerged within the BAYC community following the mint in April 2021.""I was on this Twitter Space looking over the terms when we realised, oh shoot, we have commercial rights for our apes'."" Reminiscing, he adds,""a lot of us who minted or bought didn't even realise that. We were like, what are we going to do with this?'"" Asking  and answering  that question is the key to BAYC's success; Ong notes that a flurry of projects and collaborations created momentum that drew in a new wave of holders, curious to experiment with the IP further.  The implication, seen at Apecade and around the world, is clear. Web3 technology is disrupting how brands have traditionally thought about IP. Law Professor at the University of Kentucky, Brian Fry, argues that exclusive  or centralised'  IP rights are relics of a bygone era,""<a href=""https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-nfts-could-upend-copyright-law?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email"" >when publishing and distributing works was costly</a>"", and when mechanisms were needed to ensure that creators were compensated. With rights stored on the blockchain, web3 changes those premises. The internet has already reduced the cost of publishing and distribution to virtually zero; NFTs provide the last piece of the puzzle, making it easy to verify at scale who has the rights to what, as well as providing the means to compensate creators through the blockchain.  Inclusive-exclusivity and other experiments in community culture   Speaking over video, pseudonymous NFT collector and photographer, <a href=""https://www.niftygateway.com/@lordtruffington"" >Lord Truffington</a>, recounts the time he was spotted in a London pub by a stranger  not for his own appearance, but through the lock screen on his phone, which the Italian native had saved to an image of Harry, or Ape #8526.""This is what a brand is. It is something that people recognise."" He pauses, before adding,""that's where the value of having an Ape comes in. It becomes something that is associated with your personal brand. I am Harry and Harry is me"".  Similarly, Josh Ong's Ape goes by the name <a href=""https://twitter.com/MauiPrime"" >Maui Prime</a>, whilst Adidas did not <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/ben-mayor-white"" >enter the metaverse</a> alone, they entered with <a href=""https://twitter.com/indigo_herz"" >Indigo Hertz</a>. The widespread adoption of BAYC profile pictures and the construction of identities around them helped solidify a visually identifiable sense of community. By 2022, community members were looking to turn those relationships into more palpable connections, away from the glare of computer and mobile phone screens. ""Now that we are back in a world that is open, people are looking for the physical get-togethers of their community,"" muses Scott. Seeking to tap into those desires, Subnation modelled Apecade after Andy Warhol's iconic Silver Factories of the 1960s and 80s.""The community Warhol curated would convene at Studio 54 and other locations around Manhattan,"" he explains.""When you look at that in terms of the Parisian salon during the days of Picasso, with the poets and fine artists of that time coming together to feed off of each other, you could say that we see that same thing happening right now with the digerati of our period.""  Just as any major brand is more than the sum of its visual imagery, these in-person meetups and pop-up spaces served to consolidate and empower the culture that defines BAYC today.""It didn't just happen suddenly, and it didn't happen on its own,"" explains Swickie, whose ape, Kiki, adorns one of the early covers of <a href=""https://punkscomic.com/"" >PUNKS Comic</a>, one of the Yacht Club's first major external collaborations.""Every single one of us who has been here, even the people who aren't BAYC holders, but who really supported the culture, they're all just as much a part of the story.""  Breaking into laughter, she adds,""I feel like that's what it's going to take. Everyone's got to get their butt moving."" She shares with me her wonder at what leveraging BAYC's IP has made possible, recalling Quantum Art's Los Legends NFT event in Los Angeles.""We had this panel, and as I'm sitting there listening to everybody, it suddenly clicked that the reason that we're all there is because of Kiki."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63eb6215aebb4af74dbf0fdf_FAL5JpTVUAMWxtp.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > The BAYC community is heavily reinforced by IRL events, including Quantum Art's Los Legends NFT event in Los Angeles, where, thanks to her Bored Ape, Kiki, Swicki took part in a panel. </figcaption></figure> From luxury to mass appeal   From Subnation's perspective, this has created a""new, luxury, class of goods."" Scott adds,""the community has created desirability around it."" This kind of desirability, however, can cause tension for those seeking to turn Ape-branded products into consumer brands of mass appeal.""My hope for the Apes has always been to find a way to be inclusive and to not be exclusionary,"" says Ong, adding with a slight, self-aware chuckle, that his notion of inclusive exclusivity'""sounds almost absurd."" For Yuga Labs, this looks like <a href=""https://twitter.com/culture3xyz/status/1616101662044876801"" >project extensions</a>, like the openly available ApeCoin or the much-anticipated Otherside metaverse, which allow for community engagement beyond those who hold highly-valued NFTs.  Inclusivity is critical for the entrepreneurs, like Andrew Bagg, seeking to bring the Ape brand to millions of customers. The Ape Beverages co-founder is well aware of the balance to be struck.""For us, Ape is broader than BAYC. Ape is an adjective with a positive connotation, as in Aping in' and becoming part of the web3 community and an early adopter to this emergent technology that's going to change the world.""  In this way, Ape Beverages could be classified similarly to Nike, whose business model revolves around marketing as much as sportswear. Indeed,""Just Do It"" is essentially a refined forefather to the intentionally unrefined""Aping in.""   ""We're entering a renaissance era of IP.""     Swickie   Leveraging a brand like BAYC whilst retaining creative direction over how to do so is powerful for entrepreneurs like Bagg.""Whenever you're a new brand, you have to spend a great deal of time educating the market that you exist"", he explains.""But, because we were able to associate with an already known IP, it accelerated our path tremendously. The community took to it immediately.""  The kinds of branding opportunities that web3 communities can create speak to what Edward Lee, Professor of Law at the Illinois Institute of Technology, has coined <a href=""https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=167106127002030077064099023103001089022020095078034062005090088014028069004000026117052006044120112038124024104119021072030099041091082060074089009068019103101090018001038008122124089123006105027017072095087005066106028012118124007117099102002085004&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE"" >de-collab'</a>, or decentralised collaboration. Others have called the concept <a href=""https://otherinter.net/research/headless-brands/"" >headless branding'</a>. By granting commercial IP rights to holders and building on top of ownership verified onchain, community members are incentivised to contribute to the ongoing success of the BAYC ecosystem by becoming creators in their own right.  Citing Lior Messika, founder of the Mutant Cartel, a community built by members of the BAYC ecosystem, Ong suggests how to think about this concept in practice. Comparing the Yuga Labs IP set-up to a Layer-one blockchain like Ethereum, activations like Ape Beverages and Mutant Cartel can be thought of like the Layer-two infrastructure and apps built  on  Ethereum to increase the size of the entire pie.""You have this base IP and then you have what holders are able to create as a layer on top of that,"" he explains.  From experimentation to consolidation   From web3-native community members to forward-thinking legacy brands, looking back over how the BAYC ecosystem has evolved over the past couple of years provides a masterclass in the power of decentralising IP to a project's biggest fans  its holders. ""Our belief is that the Disney of tomorrow is going to start off as a web3 project,"" Bagg predicts.""We're very bullish on IP and web3 because we feel that that is going to be the genesis of legacy brands that are still potentially unknown"". ""We're entering a renaissance era of IP,"" reiterates Swickie.""In a year, I think, we're going to be seeing Apes on TV. It's going to be a regular part of the culture, not this novelty thing.""

For holders who lack the clout that comes with superstardom or don't have an extensive background in marketing, platforms, such as <a href=""https://www.boredjobs.com/"" >Bored Jobs</a>, are emerging to help connect IP holders to potential commercial opportunities. ""There have been hundreds of different experiments at this point,"" notes Ong, musing on the many questions yet to be answered for web3 brands.""How much power can you share? How much can you decentralise whilst holding on to what a business needs to grow? We'll see some things play out better than others. It's going to be interesting to see how those experiments end up."" ",4962

Continually fascinated by human transience  "" the relationship between ageing, life, and death  "" Francien's work captures her exploration of these concepts and her efforts to redefine the stories we tell about age.  From a family of Dutch artists, Francien traces her influences back to her father.""My father was always very interested in life after death, and I grew up with this kind of background. My fascination with life and death started there, and that's connected to the death of our body. But why have a fascination for something (like this)? I don't know; it's something deeper inside of me. I'm surprised that not everybody has this fascination with their own body, because how can you not want to know more?""  Known for her melancholic life paintings of older women, Francien has enjoyed a stellar career as a figurative oil painter and is very active in the art ecosystem on Tezos, as well as Ethereum. She has exhibited work at a range of galleries and art fairs, including the ING Collection and Gallery Mokum in the Netherlands, and Scope Basel, Realisme Amsterdam, Chicago's Zhou B Art Center, and Australia's Stark Realism exhibition, amongst many others around the world.  ""What is going on is so fascinating for me.""   Francien Krieg   However, it all began at the Royal Art Academy in The Hague, where she first began exploring her fascination with the human body.""I studied Monumental Art, which is more conceptual and 3D, and I was making art with meat installations and skin; meat heads falling apart."" Though very different stylistically to her paintings today,""it was very much about the human body and anatomy.""  After graduating in 1998  "" and discovering""that I'm much more of a painter""  "" Francien went to The Free Academy of the Hague, where she first began painting the human body and developing her artistic voice.""At first, I painted with a lot of distance; my paintings never looked into somebody's eyes, you did not see the face. Later my style has become more realistic and I always had a fascination for this weird object, in the body.""  To an extent, Francien's work is an effort to understand the obscure object that is the human body.""If I look at my own body, especially seen from different perspectives and when you get these deformations, that gives me this meaning that it is a bizarre thing. We don't know anything that is going on inside our bodies. We feel so connected, I feel so close to my body, on one hand. You know, you were born in this body and you will die in this body. But somehow I feel a lot of distance to it as well; this inside of the body.

Produced over the course of 15 years, it is an enormously rich collection that blends the vulnerability that comes with age with an underlying sense of resilience.""Everybody is wrestling with the whole concept of ageing. Everybody prefers to stay young. And now I'm 49, I see in the mirror that this ageing process has also started with me. Painting these ladies helped me a lot. I have a lot of beautiful conversations because with older women in my studio. During the posing and the moment they take off their clothes, they become very open to me. That's always special."" ""By listening to their stories  "" because they have experienced a lot in their life; they have a lot of knowledge  "" it is interesting to hear that they all have the same feeling on the inside of still being the same young woman. I feel drawn to ladies who accept their ageing and wear it with pride and dignity. And it's so beautiful. I think that's, for me, an example of how I hope to also experience this.""  Indeed, as well as an exploration, Francien's work is also a dialogue, helping her understand ageing and encouraging others to think about these difficult questions, as well as simply being a canvas that records her fascination.""It started because of my own fascination for my body, but later on, I noticed it became more of a dialogue. I started painting different types of bodies, like very big women and older ladies. And for me it all began to come together."" ""I noticed that a dialogue started with the people who saw my paintings, started reacting to it, and that made it interesting as well, to see how diverse people's reactions were."" Francien had always been aware of how her art and voice brought very different messages to the kinds of paintings she was used to seeing.""For 20 years it was pretty difficult for me to sell my work, because somehow people don't want to have naked, older women on the wall!"" In the IRL world, she was likelier to see""very very heavy reactions from people thinking I could not show a naked, older woman"". Some perceived her style to be disrespectful, though Francien suggests that the negativity arises""because we are a little brainwashed that nudity is connected to sexuality, and sexuality cannot be connected to an older body. I don't think that is true, though many people see it like that.""  But everything is different in the NFT space.""Maybe these paintings are not the best paintings to hang in the living room, but in the NFT space, it's not about hanging in a living room. It's about building up a collection of art that you appreciate. NFT buyers and collectors look at art in a different way. They look more into what your art is about.""   ""The moment you dive into this community, you meet so many kind people.""   Francien Krieg   Francien notes that many people perceive cryptoart to be""a bit shallow"", but points out that""it's a very diverse audience in the Twitter space, in the NFT space"". As an ecosystem of artists, it is impossible to pigeonhole.""You have the group of people who have interest in the meaning behind the art and you have the group of people who just like to see more  "" some hip and groovy' art  "" easy art, if I can say it like that. I'm not trying to be disrespectful to those people, because everything is okay.""  Francien's point is, having broken into the NFT space only last year, that""there's an audience for everything; it's pretty diverse"". Originally of the view that NFTs were only for digital artists or animators or photoshop masters, Francien was first encouraged to exhibit her art as NFTs by the photographer Simon Beraby. He introduced Francien to LootNFT, the metaverse-driven parallel world that is now auctioning five of Francien's artworks.""The moment you dive into this community, you meet so many kind people. In the beginning, the technical side, the digital wallets; it was quite complicated for me.""  Though only recently welcomed into the cryptoart community herself, Francien now has many colleagues who she is trying to make enthusiastic as well.""I had a lot of help and I'm trying to do that too now for other people who are new to the space. That is the strength of this community: people are building this together and we are all at the beginning. There's just one way to discover: just dive into it."" ",2202

Growing up in Versailles, France with a family full of art enthusiasts, Cabline has held a natural affinity for art since she can remember. Inspired particularly by her grandfather, who was an art historian, Cabline sought to plot a path that combined expressive and intellectual pursuits. After passing the bar exam, she explains that she spent some years working as a lawyer before coming across web3 in 2021.""It was the first time, outside of my family, that I actually met other people who had the same interests as me,"" she recalls.   ""NFTs made art accessible.""    Cabline   As a woman on a mission to support under-represented artists, NFTs were a game changer for Cabline.""NFTs made art accessible. Anyone can see a mint, whether to buy or view. Everyone is invited to enjoy the art and become a part of the web3 experience,"" she says. Before working for Objkt, Cabline <a href=""https://twitter.com/cabline1/status/1407423583660523520"" >curated her own collections</a> to elevate""artists who don't make a lot of sales, despite being talented.""  Her collections feature a wide range of genres and mediums, including generative art, AI art, paintings, illustrations, animations, poetry, music, retro futuristic cyberpunk styles, alternate reality videos, and fashion art. With an interest in all genres, Cabline appreciated the versatility, influence, and experience that web3 offered. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1920px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1920px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63d92bbccd0c155cd8b9077e_calma.webp"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/64193"" > Calma </a> , by Manoloide, is Cabline's favourite piece to have ever collected.

More than anything, Cabline wanted to be a part of elevating the web3 community and helping emerging artists to share their art with the world.  After months of finding and promoting under-represented artists online, Cabline decided that she wanted to pursue a career in the web3 art scene. She interviewed with Objkt, which consisted of only three founders at the time, and was in need of a curator with a background first and foremost in the art world. She got the job.  Wanting to incorporate some elements of her social media experience into her new job, one of Cabline's early contributions was to curate mini exhibitions on the Objkt homepage.""All of the featured pieces need to have something in common, whether it be texture, shape, or colour  there needs to be cohesion,"" Cabline says, noting that this is one of the most important aspects of her job.

At school, she was encouraged to explore her artistic side.""I was really good creatively,"" she divulges.""In high school, I picked up a camera and started taking photos for our journalism class."" Angel's journey into photography may have begun early in life, but it was to prove far from linear, marked by challenges and obstacles. Though Angel enjoyed artistic subjects, she felt unable to fully apply herself. Growing up in a single-parent household, her memories are punctuated by a series of relocations.""It was hard to stick to one thing,"" she tells me.   ""My art sets me free in so many ways.""    Angel   One thing that did stick for Angel was a dream of going to college and embarking upon a career in medicine. But it wasn't to be.

Whether wading through the drudge of insomnia or the destabilising grief of a creative block, there is a tenacity  and ultimately an optimism  to Angel's artistic approach that refuses to take no' for an answer; one that leans into duress and uncovers new edges of expression on the other side.  Her discovery of colour manipulation represents one such breakthrough.""I love looking at my photos and all the colour in them. It gives me a lot of serotonin and dopamine,"" Angel says.

""One time, I developed my film and left it out for a bit,"" she confesses.""I have dogs and the film got covered in fur and dust. At first, I was like, damn, this is messed up.

How Play-to-Earn gaming can thrive in web3,how p2e can thrive in web3,Mon Jan 09 2023 14:06:49,"Few sectors have experienced as much vOla Kalejayetility in the past 12 months as web3 gaming. The sector became particularly associated with scams and speculation, and has a long way back to regain the trust, participation, and wallets of gamers. Greg Larson explains what needs to change.",Mon Jan 09 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Games; Play-2-Earn; P2e-Gaming; Applications,Greg Larson," It all seemed too good to be true. In 2021, the crypto gaming industry was abuzz with the possibility of a new play-to-earn (P2E) economy. Players flocked to blockchain games like Axie Infinity, where they could earn cryptocurrency by caring for and battling with their unique NFT creatures, and played NFT-powered 'staking games' like <a href=""https://chikn.farm/"" >Chikn</a> and <a href=""https://www.crabada.com/"" >Crabada</a> that promised advanced gameplay in some unspecified future. However, as excitement turned to disappointment, a new prevailing opinion began to emerge, that the promise of P2E gaming was nothing but a pipe dream.  But was it?  The problem with the 2021 model of crypto gaming was its reliance on speculative trading, and lack of entertaining gameplay that would sustain actual value tied to their NFTs. That left poorly planned games indistinguishable from actual scams, with both pulling the whole sector into a market crash that took the trust of players down with it.  When crypto gaming was at its peak in November 2021, CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Phil Spencer, captured the view of the gaming community when he <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2021/11/16/xbox-exploitive-nft-gaming-projects"">observed</a> that NFT games felt like they were""more exploitative than about entertainment."" Six months later, the <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/google-news-update/nft-sales-are-flatlining-is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end/dff5b977-9cae-4b14-8b4a-1b4b3c95e59e"">Wall Street Journal</a> questioned if flatlining NFT sales was the""beginning of the end"" for NFTs in gaming and elsewhere.   ""The creative I see today feels more exploitive than about entertainment.""    Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming   But it would be a mistake to write off NFTs and P2E gaming entirely. In fact, there's still massive potential for NFTs to integrate into the gaming industry in a way that's fair, enjoyable, and useful for players. This is what it might look like.  Instead of players relying on trading NFTs for a fiat return, or dev teams concentrating activity around an in-game token, successful P2E games will likely require players to earn through gameplay, such as levelling up their characters and accumulating items. These assets  "" represented as NFTs  "" could then be sold to other players, creating a true economy within a game.  By creating actual value underneath in-game assets that are tied to gameplay, this approach aligns more closely with the entertainment and escapism that have made games fun to play since their inception. It's a standard that crypto games fall far below. According to the long-time gaming executive and CEO of Laguna Games, Aron Beierschmitt, crypto games are in a""maturation phase""; speaking to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-unicorns-founder-says-p2e-gaming-is-in-a-long-maturation-phase""> Coin Telegraph </a>, he explains that the sector is""charting a path to sustainability."" By focusing on the gameplay itself rather than financial gain, that mecca of web3 gaming, sustainability, can be reached. It is only by creating an ecosystem in which people actually enjoy playing that crypto gaming can succeed. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2534px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2534px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63bc17348dac808a19d71f06_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(6).jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > An image from Crypto Unicorns, a game developed by Aron Beierschmitt's company Laguna Games. He advises web3 developers to pursue sustainability in their games, rather than embracing financial speculation. </figcaption></figure> Imagine a scenario where Fortnite skins are NFTs that can be earned through gameplay as well as bought and sold via the in-game currency. These skins not only provide a way for players to personalise their characters, but also receive special bonuses like increased movement speed or stronger defence.  This adds a new level of strategy and choice for players: they must decide whether to save or spend their currency, and decide what to purchase and what to earn. In this scenario, not only do NFTs provide a sense of accomplishment and pride for players, but they enhance the overall gameplay experience.  Another key aspect of a successful P2E model is ensuring that the use of NFTs doesn't  detract  from the overall gameplay. Free-to-play models, where players play a game for free but must pay for additional content or advantages, have proven popular in the past, but are not without detractors. Many gamers criticise this model for being overly aggressive in monetisation efforts, with constant prompts to purchase items or in-game currency. Successful P2E games should strike a balance between offering players the  opportunity  to earn an income whilst not overwhelming them with demands for further investments.  One route to this new model of web3 gaming is through dynamic metadata and NFT merging. Metadata refers to the data associated with an NFT and can represent a variety of information, such as the power level of an in-game weapon or the reputation of a character. NFT merging, on the other hand, is the process of <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/how-psychedelic-anonymous-is-betting-big-on-digital-identity"" >combining multiple NFTs</a>, such as traits, into a single, more valuable asset.  By incorporating dynamic metadata and merging into their games, developers can create games let players <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/web3-games-need-more-controlled-chaos"">upgrade NFT assets automatically</a> based on their gameplay. For example, if a player earns a high score, their character could receive a power boost as a reward. This not only ensures that NFT assets remain relevant and valuable, but it creates a sense of ownership and opens up the door to more diverse gameplay strategies.  The future of web3 gaming remains uncertain. It will take a blend of innovative gameplay, transparent businesses, and a focus on player experience to create a model that is sustainable and enjoyable. As Microsoft's Phil Spencer notes: it's important to swap exploitation for entertaining whilst emphasising genuine innovations that enhance the gaming experience. By striking this balance, NFTs have the potential to become an integral part of the games of the future. ",1847

Lost in ancient annals, Wi∂rgl played host to one of the most remarkable experiments in economic history in the aftermath of the Great Depression.  At a time when unemployment was skyrocketing, cities around the world were crumbling in economic depression, and public works projects were at a standstill, Wi∂rgl was booming.  How? A simple, local-scale currency reform designed to stimulate economic activity, through which the local government jump-started the economy, fixed the town, modernised their railway, built a new drainage system, and even built a ski jump. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3738px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3738px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63f3c300b9c4f8137ff73e35_worgl.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Now home to 12,000 people, the Austrian town of Wi∂rgl revived its fortunes with a currency experiment that holds many lessons for today. </figcaption></figure> This forgotten currency experiment, called the Freigeld, holds valuable lessons for the world of play-to-earn (P2E) gaming. In recent years, P2E gaming has faced several challenges, leading many to declare the model dead. Too many games crossed the line from monetisation to exploitation; too many more fell victim to speculators flocking to their ecosystem in hopes of striking it big, only to sell the game's reward token, thus crashing the price. However, the key to reviving this model lies in a well-designed token economy, as demonstrated by the success of the Freigeld in Wi∂rgl.  Most play-to-earn games fund rewards by attracting new players, but this often turns these games into ponzi schemes, causing partakers to quickly lose interest. The key to creating a sustainable virtual economy is to provide compelling reasons for players to continue participating, while ensuring that cashing out poses no risks. To achieve this, the in-game token must serve as more than just a reward, but as a tool that is required to play the game.  P2E gaming has the potential to not just survive, but thrive.  Despite efforts by developers to implement clever burn mechanisms to stabilise game economies, many have failed to create a successful play-to-earn structure. The reason lies in a lack of buying pressure, as the incentives to buy an in-game token are not compelling enough. By revisiting the lessons of the Freigeld, P2E gaming has the potential to not just survive, but thrive, in the web3 era.  The idea of Freigeld was created in the early 1900s by Silvio Gesell, a German economist who wanted to fix the problem of money hoarding. In a healthy economy, people are encouraged to spend money due to inflation, which makes their cash become less valuable over time. However, in a stagnant economy, there is less inflation and people hold onto their money, which reduces growth. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2722px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2722px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63f3c8655872ba5aa66c61bc_Freigeld_10.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Ten Freigeld, the equivalent of ten Schillings, with stamps on the right side denoting paid taxes. The slogan on the top left reads:""It relieves suffering; it offers work and bread."" </figcaption></figure> Gesell's solution was to introduce a tax on money holding. For this to work, there needed to be an exchange surcharge, strong asset backing, and effective distribution. Freigeld was taxed at a rate of 1% per month, with the currency stamped monthly to show that the tax had been paid. This tax, a form of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency)"" >demurrage</a>, created pressure to spend, like inflation does, but in a more stable way.  Meanwhile, the Freigeld was backed 1-to-1 with the national Austrian currency, the Schilling. But whilst Schillings could be exchange for Freigeld at no cost, to convert your Freigeld to Schilling, citizens had to pay a 2% surcharge, encouraging people to retain and spend the local currency.  The city infused Freigeld into the market by initially paying municipal workers 50% of their salaries in Freigeld, and eventually increasing that portion to 75%. This allowed the currency to begin to circulate without forcing private companies to pay their employees in Freigeld. In doing so, the local government was able to stimulate its economy by encouraging spending, and resurrect its fortunes during a major economic downturn. Writing at the time, the highly influential American economist Irving Fisher <a href=""http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~roehrigw/fisher/stamp4.html#:~:text=Schwanenkirchen%20and%20Wara.-,woergl,-Compared%20with%20the"" >reported favourably</a> about the experiment, inspiring later initiatives like the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiemgauer"" >Chiemgauer</a>, which has operated in Bavaria, Germany, since 2003, and now has a money supply in excess of a million euros.  Lessons from Freigeld can be directly translated into a more sustainable P2E gaming economy. Wi∂rgl's experiment would only ever work at a local level, with a national currency to back it. But that is all a gaming economy needs. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:458px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""458px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63f3cb3e520a2d35c6e31ada_labourer.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Wi∂rgl labourers stamping their Freigeld. </figcaption></figure> To illustrate this, let's lay out a potential in-game economy for a fictional game called Cloud Striker. The game will use a two-coin structure, inspired by the Freigeld and the Schilling. The two coins are: the in-game coin, $SKY, which is the equivalent to the Freigeld; and the gold standard coin, like the US dollar, which is equivalent to the Schilling.  Like Wi∂rgl labourers, who were paid in Freigeld, rather than the Schilling, Cloud Striker players would also swap fiat currency for the local $SKY. That buy-in gives the player a starting amount of the in-game token to participate in the in-game economy, worth perhaps around $40, equivalent to many games on the market today.  The in-game token must serve as more than a reward, but a tool that is required to play.  Earning $SKY in the game would be possible through various actions as players progress. These actions include normal gameplay mechanics, such as receiving a bounty for defeating enemies. Additionally, players could earn $SKY for completing missions or side quests, a concept familiar to any gamer.  Details aside, even after earning initial buy-ins from players, one of the key challenges to creating a successful in-game economy is incentivising those players to hold onto or spend their tokens in-game. This can be achieved by making the token a requirement to continue progressing.  In Cloud Striker, players could only progress in their campaign by using the in-game token. For example, after beating a boss and unlocking the next level, players must pay or hold a certain amount of $SKY to keep playing. This discourages players from selling their in-game token, since they'll need it to keep playing. In addition, certain in-game abilities, status symbols, customisations, events, locations, or competitions, might only be available to players who accumulate a certain amount of $SKY, with other assets available to purchase, creating genuine demand for the token.  Meanwhile, a key aspect of the Freigeld was about encouraging people to spend, rather than hoard. This creates demand in the economy and keeps it healthy. To that end, Cloud Striker would adopt a stamp tax similar to the Freigeld, where players are taxed for holding $SKY for too long. Similarly, this creates a situation where players are incentivised to spend, purchase, and earn $SKY  ""‚Äì all without making the game a""pay-to-play"" experience.  Gaming tokenomics need fundamental reimagining.  The final key to ensuring a stable in-game economy is to peg the $SKY token to an established currency like the dollar. This helps to prevent price fluctuations and ensures that players treat $SKY as a long-term asset, not as a speculative investment. Ensuring this stability provides confidence in the game and its economy.  In the Freigeld model, the local government profits from being a key part of the local economy, rather than from holding a currency that appreciates in value. This same principle applies to $SKY, as the developers should receive a portion of the taxes to cover their costs and earn a profit, while players earn through gameplay, not through the token's appreciation.  Regardless of the tactics that developers adopt, gaming tokenomics need fundamental reimagining. The Freigeld experiment demonstrated the potential for alternative currency systems to drive positive change in communities. In the world of gaming, adopting these principles could not only improve the player experience, but also challenge the traditional economics of the industry. ",2704

Rarity and inherent value aside, many NFT holders have aligned their digital avatars with their physical appearance, perhaps on the basis of skin or hair color, interests, or values. Others have taken the inverse route by making a trait within an NFT a staple of their IRL identity and personal brand.   Take Manifold.xyz founder <a href=""https://twitter.com/richerd"" >Richerd</a>. He's the owner of CryptoPunk #6046, a mid-level rarity Punk sporting a cigarette and blue and red 3D glasses. To align his digital and physical identities, Richerd wears a real pair of 3D glasses wherever he goes. Then, in October 2022, he turned down an offer of 2,500 eth (almost $9.5 million at the time) for his Punk. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62d8318c93c8a4091890864e_GQ138YdWKGsONewqrLCsCiiVtJxZBTEmGgdWa9yQ8WyhcxRh8KsIbAnIdn4tTg7-GanCIeojzj0SsDChNfnm2n2TmVm22VEbflB57Q5vzd0-FbtY8B38ggnEEXU80FDLz2Rz1NehVYCatZAmZPa5l3k.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""http://sence.    https://twitter.com/RTFKT/status/1457470266796384257  It"">RTFKT</a> included blue red 3D glasses as a trait to tap into Richerd's brand.</figcaption></figure> Richerd knew that the offer far exceeded the value of the NFT itself  "" the sale would have been comfortably the highest CryptoPunk sale at the time. But he <a href=""https://twitter.com/richerd/status/1449187165875826693?lang=en"">argued</a> that""to me, my brand, identity, and what I'm building in the NFT space will be way more valuable in the long run."" #6046 was a key part of what made Richerd, Richerd. Since buying the Punk in early 2021, he has built his brand around the iconic blue and red through his DAO, Manifold, and his public web3 presence.  There's method to the madness. Our physical appearance is one of the biggest outlets for self-expression. Fashion, accessories, and tattoos all serve as opportunities for us to express our authentic selves, and digital identities are no different. Nobody in web3 should be surprised that Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter are all experimenting with letting users show their NFTs.  This same behaviour will continue as we spend more time in the virtual world. That's why widely-respected projects like Psychedelics Anonymous (PA), are betting big on the next wave of digital identity.  Divine Entities   In December 2021, <a href=""https://psychedelicsanonymous.com/"" >Psychedelics Anonymous</a> was introduced to the world, the brainchild of Lewis Gale, who as founder of the brand agency Vultura has accumulated decades of experience in tech and media. The highly-anticipated project featured four collections (Genesis, IRL Pass, Metaverse Pass, and Component #1), each of which sold out almost instantly. Since its first mint, PA has continued to develop its expansive PAverse ecosystem and build a community around psychedelic therapy and reducing the stigma of mental health. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:780px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""780px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62d82dbfc71c600118ca65ab_ad4xuetWMWGbT1XyZaaKA5r99RKAOVpqP_24uNu3s7dgytABCt-YCKH_TWcgBhhCD3anRo6NZs0Z4yoALBkoW4RWykA_kDROpxb2kgqB1vganbiw5avcmMm-pVu5yJXYB1zxZmnR3eIsjWdQIr09b_0.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption >Image from <a href=""https://2nft.org"">2nft.org</a>.</figcaption></figure> Now, the organisation has introduced its biggest bet yet: the <a href=""https://twitter.com/psychedelic_nft/status/1539228838906953731"">Divine Entities</a> marketplace.  Divine Entities (DE) is a platform designed to drive the next wave of customisable NFT-powered digital identities by allowing collectors to deconstruct their DE-enabled ERC721 tokens into individual traits. Psychedlics Anonymous envisions a world where users can buy, sell, and trade their traits on the open marketplace, equipping their avatars however they see fit. The team believes opening up a trait economy will create an ecosystem in which""millions of users will buy, sell, swap, and equip traits to customize, profit, and/or express themselves progressively through their NFT digital identities.""  To start, Psychedelics Anonymous will launch its own collection of traits on the marketplace, releasing new masks, suits, hoodies, faces, pins, and patterns. All traits will be swappable and customisable to the Genesis avatars, PA's original collection. Meanwhile, a second collection from the PA sister project Ezu will follow shortly after. The marketplace will be powered by a new token, $PSY, and governed by a DAO.  Introducing: trait economies   It is important to note that Divine Entities is a groundbreaking innitiative and that the Psychedelics Anonymous project is very much a work in progress. However, if executed properly, the ability to buy, sell, and swap traits at a trait level will have massive implications for the web3 ecosystem more broadly, affecting creators and collectors, artists and project founders, and developers and builders.  For creators and collectors, the possibility to exchange individual traits has enormous potential. It allows community members and collectors to embraced more nuanced and individual forms of self-expression, customising their NFTs as their preferences evolve alongside broader trends in fashion and culture.  Meanwhile, it gives artists and project founders an addition tool to engage their communities and drive additional revenue, through the sale of exclusive traits and utility-based add-ons. Blockchain games can release trait packs, similar to downloadable content, that provide various forms of utility, in-game performance boosts, and other expansionary features.  Of course, developers must be cautious of both creating a game that devolves into pay-to-win, as well as attempting to extract value from players without creating a better game or experience. But there is merit in the idea in principle, and there is enormous scope for creators to introduce deeper value and innovative uses of a trait economy. The recent and <a href=""https://www.culture3.com/posts/gamestop-the-show-gmes-nft-marketplace"" >highly successful</a> entrance of GameStop to the NFT marketplace sector reflects the natural synthesis between gaming and NFTs and the significant value proposition that exists for gamers and developers alike.  Perhaps the most promising angle is the ability to onboard web2 brands to web3 through licensing and partnership deals. Take the Snapchat Bitmoji store for example, where brands like Ralph Lauren, Jordan, Converse, and Warby Parker have <a href=""https://www.glossy.co/fashion/bitmoji-attracting-ad-dollars-from-big-fashion-brands/"" >invested heavily </a>in partnerships, offering virtual garments and accessories to Snapchat's 332 million global daily active users (70% of whom have a Bitmoji). <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:929px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""929px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62d84dcfc98c7d0b1184f0e3_a6ad09087842f02abb82bb4dc8619fb0.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >Fronted by Chance the Rapper, Ralph Lauren began their Bitmoji partnership with a twelve-piece ""Max and Match"" line inspired by IRL designs.</figcaption></figure> The same concept applies here. People value the ability to express their digital identities, and until now, the ability to mix and match traits in web3 has been only a pipe dream. With Divine Entities, PA wants to let Richerd collaborate with Moonbirds on a set of 3D glasses or let Bored Apes put an adidas headband on their PFP. The possibilities are endless: leveraging a supply of traits can create markets similar to those of collectibles like streetwear and sneakers, the latter of which has grown to a billion-dollar resale market. And just as there are NFT flippers, there will be those who focus solely on NFT traits.  The opportunity is widely acknowledge, and organisations like TraitSwap have emerged to build the next step for NFTs. As with Divine Entities, TraitSwap's infrastructure allows users to buy, sell, and trade existing PFP traits on their marketplace, whilst empowering companies to launch new trait collections. TraitSwap's platform is already live, and was met with a positive reception when it launched with the Fancy Bears metaverse collection. The organisation is now in the process of onboarding over 30 collections including Bored Ape Yacht Club and Azuki.  Only a few weeks removed from the announcement, much is uncertain about what this platform and economy will look like. It remains to be seen whether trait economies will receive attention from the dominant NFT marketplaces and whether Psychedelics Anonymous can bring existing blue-chip creations onboard to accelerate their roadmap.  Time will tell, but one thing is certain: the emphasis on digital identities is here to stay, and innovation will come.  ",2674
How Reuben Wu is pioneering a new artform with NFTs,how reuben wu is pioneering a new artform with nfts,Tue Jan 17 2023 15:33:45,"Whilst touring the world as a musician, Reuben Wu found a new passion: photography. The multidisciplinary artist uses the concepts of time and space to tell compelling stories about the vast world we inhabit. He speaks to Nina Knaack Knaack about making art with drones and his search for ideas that have never been done before.",Tue Jan 17 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Photography; Drones; Music; Europe; Uk,Nina Knaack," Reuben Wu has wanted to be an artist for as long as he can remember. Whilst at school, he felt like an outsider, and left with a hunger for recognition and success.""It galvanised me,"" he says.""I wanted to become so good that I could not be ignored by anyone.""  That mindset has stuck with him ever since, but whilst Reuben is now known around the world as a photographer, he originally channelled his creative energy via a different medium: music. In 1999, he formed the electronic band Ladytron with friends in Liverpool; what started as a side project became a music career of ten years that took him around the world. ""I quit my industrial designer job to focus on the band full time,"" he recalls.""The music was extremely rewarding. Our intention was to make the music that we wanted to make, and that no one else was making."" Ladytron gave the keyboardist a sense of belonging within this small group of indie music lovers that he hadn't felt before. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1080px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1080px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63c6ce8ec58624a6517815dd_last%20hope.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > An image from Reuben Wu's  <a href=""https://www.behance.net/gallery/11281449/Last-Hope"">Last Hope</a>  collection, created in 2013. </figcaption></figure> Awkward and quiet as a child, Reuben explains that he spent most of his time drawing or exploring on his own; losing himself in national parks or his own imagination. Feeling most at home in nature, travelling with the band gave him the opportunity to discover some of the most beautiful places on earth. Whilst on tour, the urge to document the landscapes around him led him to his current craft.  Although he was accustomed to drawing scenery, Reuben noticed that it was too time consuming with his surroundings changing so quickly.""We were touring all over the world and I wanted to ensure that I didn't miss a single thing, so I picked up a camera as a way of making an image diary."" Starting out with just the camera attachment on a Palm Pilot, Reuben's first photos were""low-bit, low-resolution, horrible greyscale pictures.""  He soon upgraded to a normal smartphone with a built-in camera, but felt, still, that there was something missing in the digital shots they produced. Experimenting with a range of different mediums and tools, he found his way to film photography.""I discovered this texture, this beautiful quality to the negatives that digital did not have,"" he recalls.  Enjoying the ritualistic practices that accompany film, Reuben began to think about photography as a craft, more than simply just photos.""It involves setting up your camera, loading film, sending the film off, and then scanning the negatives,"" he explains.""I realised that doing photography tapped into the visual art side of me that I had always connected with through drawing.""  Having been drawn to wild places since early childhood, Reuben's love for nature is rooted within him.""Being by myself in nature taught me about the value of solitude and the sublime landscape. I never felt more alive and free than being alone in the mountains."" This, combined with Reuben's obsession with science fiction, explains his fascination for the natural and the supernatural, the known and the unknown.  To create the sense of ambiguity that he loves so much in his work, Reuben started to use a drone as a kind of flying light beam, with the navigation systems enabling him to create geometric shapes in the air.""I use the semi-automatic manoeuvre of the drone to paint a light source for, or frame around, my subject matter within a landscape,"" he explains.  Reuben's original photographic methods bless him with a unique sense of freedom.""The old adage of waiting for the right moment and the right light was not enough. I needed to create it, not wait for it. I really like the fact that this aesthetic and these images transcend their own medium. I am always looking for elusive things that were not thought to be possible before.""   ""I needed to cross boundaries.""    Reuben Wu   When Ladytron collectively decided to take a break from music, Reuben knew that he had to pursue photography. Reuben made it his mission to experiment with different cameras and different mediums. Recalling the sense of opportunity he felt upon discovering film photography, Reuben embraced the idea of capturing reality in a new way.""I really like this idea of the camera being able to reveal so much more about the landscape than the eye can see,"" he says. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63c6d1e46728acf6e0ef0083_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(1).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://fourteenthcenturyseries.com/""> Fourteenth Century Sky </a> , by Reuben Wu. </figcaption></figure> The years that followed were not at all easy, and Reuben struggled to decide what kind of photographer he wanted to be. It was around this time that he moved to the US, travelling for commercial work whilst he pursued his own style. ""Photography, for me, should be about the picture itself and whether it moves you in some way,"" he says, noting that film photography, by contrast, had become limiting for him. He wanted to push boundaries in a different way.""I wanted to create new, special art that people did not expect, and I realised that I needed to cross boundaries within the medium of photography in order to do that.""   ""I am keen to always explore what is new.""    Reuben Wu   Reuben embraced digital photography once again, and started to experiment with the features that accompanied it, from video to time-lapse. But it was in new technologies where Reuben felt most comfortable, using drones to capture images create artificial lighting. Venturing out to remote locations, drones illuminated vast natural structures in ways that they had never been shown before. ""I tried to approach landscape photography in a way that felt new and original,"" he explains.""Every day we are bombarded with beautiful photos of our world. I strongly felt I needed to go beyond that and asked myself, How can I change my own perception of our planet, and make it seem new and unexplored?'"" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63dbcbd0e33ce3568d76c647_gettyimages-891254248-1024x1024-transformed.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://foundation.app/@itsreuben/metamorphe/3""> Sight </a> , a collaboration with  <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/jenni-pasanen""> Jenni Pasanen </a>  for their Metamorphe collection. </figcaption></figure> In that light, the link with web3 is easily made.""I like jumping into things that other people are not doing,"" Reuben notes, explaining how he minted his first work in January 2021, at a time when there were not many photographers minting on the blockchain.""Maybe I also never really felt like a true photographer"", he muses.""In a way, my work looks like renderings and, perhaps because of that, they easily fitted in with the NFTs of digital artists. In general, I just do not feel bound to the rules of a medium. I am keen to always explore what is new.""  The reward for that exploration has been turning a hobby into a career that is both prosperous and developmental.""Minting NFTs has motivated me to spend more time on my personal work,"" Reuben explains.""I finally had an end goal for autonomous projects and it shortened the cycle of creation, because you finalise a piece by minting it. It forced me to be sure of my work before immortalising it on the blockchain forever.""  And beyond a career, web3 has provided Reuben with collaborators and community that engenders the same feeling of belonging provided by Ladytron years ago.""Web3 has allowed me the freedom to create the work that I love."" It also helped him find it. ",2386

Web3 and the metaverse is no different, as major brands like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/ben-mayor-white"" >Adidas</a>, Gucci, and others experiment with events and campaigns in metaverse worlds and their own virtual experiences. And while some early efforts are far from perfect, all resemble a bright flicker of what the future holds. ""Brands are joining the metaverse because it's going to be the future of the internet,"" says Sam Huber, founder of LandVault, a studio that builds experiences in metaverses, such as Decentraland, for companies like Google and PayPal.""Entering the metaverse today is essentially an insurance policy for staying relevant when users migrate from 2D to 3D.""  That opinion is widely shared amongst metaverse-focused studios.""If brands don't have a web3 strategy soon they will lose their audience,"" predicts Tony Pearce, CEO of the metaverse gaming company Reality+, which has worked with the likes of ITV and the BBC. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2560px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2560px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/640b6ddc53a7576237e87793_adidas-ready-player-me-scaled.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Adidas is amongst the major fashion brands joining the metaverse. </figcaption></figure> The notion that better virtual experiences will become critical for brands is prevalent amongst industry insiders like Sam, despite the topic falling down the agenda in recent months. Indeed, he suggests that the perfect time for brands to begin experimenting is when the stakes are lower.""You can create your own experience, like Heineken did with their Silver Brewery in Decentraland, or sponsor significant areas,"" he explains.""Even something as simple as a virtual billboard shows people that your brand is part of metaverse culture.""  At the same time, metaverse platforms themselves are also innovating. Tony suggests that the new live streaming functionality on The Sandbox opens up new opportunities for brands, particularly in entertainment.""You might even see a brand like HBO launch a new series and have it premier in a metaverse cinema,"" he suggests.  Ultimately, there is no single strategy that works across every company.""Brands need to look at the metaverse and think about how it can work for them, while also making it simple for users,"" Tony says.   ""Brands are joining the metaverse because it's going to be the future of the internet.""    Sam Huberg, Founder of LandVault   The metaverse is increasingly a space where culture is born, fostered, and disseminated into both web3 and the real world. Few events exemplify this more than the annual Metaverse Fashion Week (MVFW) in Decentraland, with brands like Dolce &amp; Gabbana joining over 100,000 unique attendees <a href=""https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/metaverse-fashion-week-the-hits-and-misses"" >in March 2022</a>. ""MVFW generated close to $5 million in overall economic activity,"" says Sam, whose company consulted some of the brands that participated.""There was also close to a 70 per cent conversion rate on digital merchandise for brands, which is enormous."" The expectation in the industry is that this foreshadows something much bigger. <a href=""https://www.marketwatch.com/story/luxury-in-the-metaverse-morgan-stanley-says-it-could-become-a-50-billion-market-11637058661"" >Morgan Stanley</a> estimates that for luxury goods alone, the metaverse could reach 10% of the market by 2030, creating a ¬£45 billion revenue opportunity and a 25% lift to the industry's profit pool.  Although the overall attendance numbers for MVFW are not eye-popping, the value of economic activity and the extremely high conversion rate signal great potential for brands that are early in co-creating digital culture through the metaverse. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:787px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""787px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/640b6eaee24ff93a86fdcd36_YXNzZXRzL25mdHdvcmxkX2FsaWVuZG9vZ2xlcyg0KS5wbmc%3D.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >  LandVault is a studio that builds experiences in metaverses such as Decentraland for companies like Google and PayPal.  </figcaption></figure>""You see multi-million dollar brands being built on Instagram in a very short amount of time,"" observes Diego Borgo, a web3 strategist for the likes of Salesforce and ≈†koda.""The metaverse is no different. Those who understand the medium and culture  and how to position themselves within it  can leapfrog competitors over the next five years.""  Mike Litman, Senior Web3 and NFT Director at creative agency Media.Monks, argues that successful brand entry into the metaverse comes down to the three C's: culture, community, and commerce. ""As a brand you have to be creative and inventive with culture,"" Mike says.""Then you can go out and build a community around those ideas. And once you've built a community, you then have a captive audience you can promote to.""  What Mike cautions is that all too often, brands skip directly to the commerce part before building cultural creativity and community in an organic fashion. Following the culture-first framework in the right order puts brands in a stronger and more sustainable position.  Participating in and co-creating metaverse cultural events like the Metaverse Fashion Week is one such example of brands prioritising cultural creativity. And if brands push further, they can create entirely new metaverse tribes out of IP that has been doing little beyond <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/how-notable-brands-can-use-nfts-to-revitalise-their-ip"" >collecting dust on the shelf</a>.  When Tony began brainstorming metaverse ideas with ITV, one of the UK's largest TV networks, he browsed the back catalogue to gain inspiration. What resulted is a powerful example of how the metaverse can create value from IP that was previously collecting dust on the shelf. ""I found this old show called  Thunderbirds  which was really doing nothing for ITV Studios at the time,"" he recalls.""I decided to take that old licence and fast forward it by relighting the fire in the metaverse.""  The result was a metaverse replica of the  Thunderbirds  headquarters in The Sandbox, where people can embark upon rescue missions just like the superheroes from the show. Pearce says that the metaverse initiative, augmented with NFT avatars and collectibles, has spiked interest in  Thunderbirds  from a new, younger audience.  His experience with  Thunderbirds  illustrates how the metaverse can make sense even for brands whose positioning is not as innovative as their competitors. Embracing virtual experiences is often a low-risk, high-reward endeavour to reboot and refresh.   ""If brands don't have a web3 strategy soon they will lose their audience.""     Tony Pearce, CEO of Reality+  ""Realistically, you're not going to reach millions of people in the metaverse,"" explains Sam, noting the range of clients that LandVault works with.""What you can do is convert and deepen relationships with the audience already present, and we're already seeing that with some of the less sexy' brands like Tyson Foods and Standard Chartered Bank.""  Since the metaverse is still in its infancy, brands have the luxury of experimenting with how they engage with those audiences. But as more people migrate into virtual worlds, and the back-end technology improves, how brands interact through the metaverse will continue to evolve. ""You need to make things super simple,"" says Tony.""Blockchain games and metaverse experiences can be full of friction for the user, not to mention intimidating jargon. We're working with the BBC on a trading card game with Doctor Who, but nowhere do we mention words like blockchain or NFT."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/640b70e4e24ff9f397fef195_Yuga_Labs__Sewer_Pass_NFT_collection_sells_12.8M_in_first_day.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><em>The Yuga Labs Sewer Pass generated over $6 million in sales in only a few hours. </figcaption></figure> Mike adds that the concept of developing a tribal identity in the metaverse is taking off, particularly in relation to digital assets.""I call it The New Flex,' where people signal their personality through material goods. Whether it's a pair of NFT sneakers or membership to a community, like Yuga Labs has done with the Sewer Pass, digital assets in the metaverse are going to be a new way of expressing individuals' identity.""  The potential for brands in the metaverse is immense, but some ways of going about it are better than others. Pearce's  Thunderbirds  project is perfect evidence that it's not about name brand recognition or dropping expensive NFTs. Instead, it's about creating tribes, communities, and interactions that let people express themselves in the metaverse in ways that feel more unique and exciting than the real world.""That's something I talk about a lot with the brands I consult with,"" says Mike.""It's really important.""

Talented artists join the ecosystem every day, and the tools that they use to mint their art as NFTs are improving at a rapid pace.

Michael Beets' The Passage completely flips that narrative. Created with his immersive cryptoart organisation HERE &amp; NOW, the experience seeks to recreate the feeling of walking into an artist's gallery, seeing their art on display, and speaking directly with them about their work.""The process of minting an NFT right now is cold and lifeless; there's no emotion behind it,"" Michael says.""The art carries emotion, but there's no emotion in the experience of buying it."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1689px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1689px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63f4ae0743c6978e1fefb2fb_image1.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Each exhibit is designed to be experienced in a different way, whether by walking, climbing, or flying. </figcaption></figure> Choices are presented to you as you continue through The Passage.

Michael Beets, Creator of The Passage   The Passage is an immersive and interactive NFT minting experience that takes participants on a virtual journey through a breathtakingly vivid gallery of generative art comprising the work of twelve talented creators, including <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/sasha-stiles"" >Sasha Stiles and </a><a href=""https://twitter.com/JimenaBuenaVida"" >Jimena Buena Vida</a>. When you enter the <a href=""https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/24807"" >token-gated</a> gallery, you have as much control over your POV as you would in a first-person video game, and you're given instructions on how to continue.  As you move through the space, ethereal music accompanies you with intriguing vistas, which could not possibly exist in the real world, beckoning you forward. Limitless skies and structures that defy the rules of space permeate the gallery, instilling a pervasive sense of having been transported to another world. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63f4abe3302d5f57f3e2fb45_ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > An excerpt of Daeinc's Knowledge', the full version of which will be released on The Passage. </figcaption></figure> Dispersed in this space are exhibits of artworks from twelve generative artists, totalling 300 pieces and curated by Chris Ostoich.""We found a really amazing curator in him,"" Michael muses.""We told him the concept and got him to think about it and approach artists with it. So you kind of got all these interesting perspectives from different artists, all taking that concept and putting their spin on it.""  These works are inspired by pitch drop experiments, long-term experiments which measure the drip of very thick liquids over many decades. The longest running such experiment has been in action since 1927 at the University of Queensland, Australia, where pitch, a type of polymer, has dripped just nine times over the course of almost a century.  In contrast to the web3 ecosystem, where events move at breakneck speed, second only to the fear of missing out, The Passage creates a slow, soothing experience. Michael explains that the pitch drop experiment theme is intended to bring attention to how time is perceived in web3.""Things move so fast, we don't breathe, or take in the art that we are collecting."" In The Passage, viewers are instead prompted to take their time, much like in a pitch drop experiment, and absorb every detail of the artwork in front of them.  Each exhibit has its own, unique aesthetic, some expansive, some compact, and each designed to be experienced in a different way, whether that be by walking, climbing, or even flying, as you view the artworks therein. Moving from exhibit to exhibit, every choice that you make  which door you open, how long you gaze at a piece of art, whether you go left or right at a fork in the road  is recorded, and eventually influences the appearance of the art that is generated for you at the end of your journey through The Passage.  This will be the second iteration of The Passage, the first having been released to a warm reception last year. Many of the ideas explored in that genesis iteration have been carried over to this season's The Passage. However, and newly, this season has seen an integration with fx(hash), the leading generative art platform on Tezos.  ""fx(hash) were fully on board,"" Michael explains, enthusing how his team had access to their new fxparams tool, which makes it easy for external creators to release art through the fx(hash) platform.  ""It's almost like a layer on top of fx(hash),"" Michael explains.""This is the big difference: we're really plugged into an entire ecosystem.""  The Coin, which is used as an entry ticket to The Passage, is currently <a href=""https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/24807"" >available for minting</a>, with the gallery itself opening on March 7th. Each coin allows you to mint one generative art piece from a featured artist. In addition to Sasha Stiles and Jimena Buena Vida, the current lineup is completed by 1mposter, Aleksandra Jovaniƒá, Kesean, Karan4d, Victor Doval, Daeinc, Sam Tsao, William Watkins, Jeres, and Ivona Tau, though it will change many times over the course of the year.   ""Things move so fast, we don't breathe, or take in the art that we are collecting.""     Michael Beets, creator of The Passage   Augmented by the immersive design of The Passage, the art created by these artists makes for an NFT minting experience unlike any other with The Passage. The experience brings an element of order to the random nature of generative art, tying your own journey and choices to guide the creation of the art you see at the end.  The emotion that comes with being able to move through a gallery and see the artwork in a three dimensional space like you would in a physical gallery is deeply satisfying, and it sparks a feeling of gratification knowing that the art that will ultimately be minted at the end of your experience is a collaborative work between the artists, the platform, and your own choices within it.

Crypto Tribalism: how the pursuit of genius in web3 creates division,how the pursuit of genius in web3 creates division,Tue Mar 07 2023 11:04:53,"Crypto's tribal culture is intimately tied to its libertarian origins, but the pursuit of a liberated space has to be reconciled with the crypto ecosystem's elevation of 'geniuses'. Tyler Scharf explores how the conflict between genius and non-hierarchy Lea Rose Emeryds to factions and conflict.",Tue Mar 07 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Community-society,Cryptoculture; Opinion,Tyler Scharf," Crypto culture has a peculiar landscape. To the outsider it appears mysterious: armies of anonymous characters with colorful profile pictures on Twitter representing obscure internet money with a market cap as large as Amazon.  In part this mystery is rooted in the unfounded belief that technological genius is needed to navigate the space.  One look beneath the surface reveals the multiple layers of this complexity, and the ideological division that this can foster. Various factions warring against each other, each with their core figureheads, fighting for their core values.  The roots of this divisivenesses can be traced back to the inception of crypto culture. On the genesis block of Bitcoin, a commemorative message was inscribed:  The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.   This reference to the Global Financial Crisis was both a protest against the bailout of the ""too big to fail"" banks and a manifesto for the general public to take control of money into their own hands. Bitcoin is the answer: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, decentralised, trustless, with a fixed inflation rate and capped at 21 million tokens forever. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:512px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""512px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/640714176cb87fefcc610454_AJ5RgYAr6FL188jha_mu1dGbRJFM0QOSVPnkRuT7s-WVdsCsDbgU6VSjKnb4yfnTjDno4PdcUSCiMB7WtVC3rOQA5mUdkJ148neOuUbmutUVyv3IGCg3%3Ds512.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption >  ""The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,"" written on the very first Bitcoin block. Crypto's tribal culture is intimately tied to its origins. </figcaption></figure> It is no wonder that crypto's libertarian, even anarchist, roots have resulted in comparisons to <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/robness"" >Occupy Wall Street</a>. Crypto OG's tend to be independent, self-starting, and distrusting of institutions; venture capitalists and institutions are not welcome in this space. Even selling courses and educational content is frowned upon because all information should be open-source.  In a 2021 political <a href=""https://metagov.org/cryptopolitics"">survey</a> carried out by Metagov, 45% of respondents believed that crypto is a political philosophy, as opposed to an economic technology, of which 42% identified as libertarians and 19% as anarcho-capitalists. Web3's revolutionary roots remain strong.  Even through these prisms, the tribal nature of crypto culture can seem mysterious. Crypto is, after all, technological infrastructure that enables a range of use cases. But in the web3 subculture, arguments will erupt around apparently trivial topics, like blockspace, which reveal the philosophical underpinnings of the blockchain itself.  For example, take the recent debate about Bitcoin NFTs. Ordinals are an innovative way to bring non-fungible tokens to Bitcoin: an image is inscribed' onto a satoshi (a hundred millionth of a bitcoin) which becomes forever immortalised on the chain.  Bitcoin as a protocol is essentially in a state of ossification due to <a href=""https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/exploring-bitcoins-core-values-and-why-we-defend-them/"" >veto-based governance</a> that makes reaching consensus very difficult, but individual developers are still free to innovate on top of that base layer, as Casey Rodarmor did with <a href=""https://rodarmor.com/blog/ordinal-theory/"" >ordinal theory</a> to create the early primitives of these Bitcoin NFTs.  Not all Bitcoin users are keen on digital artifacts, however. Some see this as <a href=""https://read.pourteaux.xyz/p/illegitimate-bitcoin-transactions"" >a waste of blockspace</a> and are even <a href=""https://twitter.com/MikeIppolito_/status/1619729791015583746"" >encouraging censorship</a> from miners, a major departure from one of the few things those in crypto typically agree on: anti-censorship. Ultimately, the crux of this divide is found in the permissionless maxi  the blockchain is open for anyone to use as they see fit  versus the bitcoin maxi: the blockchain was created as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and should not be used for anything else.  Those who do support Ordinals are either in it for the technology, as this is a new technical use of the protocol, or are degens after the money (the highest sale so far has been <a href=""https://twitter.com/punk9059/status/1624180122793177088"" >11.5 btc / $255k </a>for an Ordinal Punk).  A strong case can be made that the leading reason for such divisive tribal culture in crypto is its hyper financialisation. After all, when individuals can make hundreds of thousands in a single transaction, the stakes get a lot higher.   ""Crypto loves killing the main character.""     <a href=""https://andrecronje.medium.com/learn-from-my-mistakes-4cc8faf98468"" > Andre Cronje </a>  Andre Cronje is widely seen as the genius architect who co-founded multiple innovative projects, including DeFi protocol yearn.finance and the Fantom blockchain. He caused controversy in March 2022 when he quit DeFi, ""<a href=""https://beincrypto.com/andre-cronje-quits-defi-projects-billions-dollars-jeopardy/"" >leaving billions in jeopardy</a>"". Of course, this was untrue: it was trivial for other developers to pick up Cronje's open source projects and continue maintenance.  The supposed jeopardy was rooted in the narrative: Cronje was the genius whose groundbreaking ideas created wealth; without him it was impossible for the wealth to continue coming in. Crypto has a tendency of latching onto the personality behind the tech, and then, in Cronje's words,""crypto loves killing the main character.""  Cronje returned to crypto this year with warm reception because his contributions were net positive. Others were less deserving of such a welcome.  Dani Sesta, Do Kwon, Su Zhu, Kyle Davies, Sam Bankman Fried, and Caroline Ellison are some of the more recent examples of Crypto Twitter hero geniuses turned villains as their respective projects failed, taking billions of user funds with them.  They had all pushed memes that went viral in the subculture: Sesta and his <a href=""https://twitter.com/danielesesta/status/1460207916422778881?s=20"" >frog nation</a>'; Kwon and his <a href=""https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1524331194883579905?s=20"" >lunatics</a>'; Zhu and the <a href=""https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1363035740507017216?s=20"" >supercycle</a>'; Bankman-Fried and his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcWpYmMs_do"" >quant team</a> of math geniuses.

And for many, basic human values can easily be foregone when price becomes a pain point.  Crypto is a curious industry. Because so little is actually known about the future of this technology, most participants do their best to stay humble; it is the only way to survive. However, that lack of knowledge makes it easy for malicious actors to seize the narrative. A purported genius can become thrust into that of a scenius. ""Scenius,"" says Brian Eno,""stands for the intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene. It is the communal form of the concept of the genius."" Because of the vastness of the crypto space, it is rare that a scenius can belong to the entire cultural scene. Instead the scenius is a part of one or more particular factions, tapped into the narrative of that crew.  We tend to get swept up in narratives, whether we are technologists, degens, DAOists or otherwise. Much like explorers of old, those like Columbus did not know where they were heading, just that it had immense potential in shaping our collective future. ",2537
How to pick an NFT conference in 2023,how to pick an nft conference in 2023,Wed Jan 25 2023 14:14:58,"Web3's conference calendar is more full than ever before, with 10 major NFT events between February and May. Signal explains how to pick in a crowded calendar.",Wed Jan 25 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Community-society,Conference; Nft-Paris; Veecon,Signal," As we approach February, conference season is officially upon us. And despite a damp macroeconomic environment, there are more web3 conferences to pay attention to than ever before. Notably, both Yuga Labs and Azuki have announced that they will not be attending NFT NYC. That means no ApeFest in New York, whilst Azuki has also announced that it will not be attending NFT LA either. This ties in with how we have seen these communities behave in the past few months, with Yuga Labs looking to expand beyond the NFT market. Azuki, meanwhile, may be shifting its focus to Asia, where the majority of its holders are based.  But these communities are dropping out of conferences for the same reason: the calendar is filling up, and fast. There are at least ten major web3 events occurring between February and May, including ETH Denver, Non-Fungible Conference Lisbon, and PROOF of Conference.  Also amongst those ten is NFT Paris and VeeCon, which were the best two of the many conferences I attended in 2022. Here's why.  For one, the location plays a crucial role in the success of these events. Having a central venue where everyone is forced to meet makes life easy. The attendees, speakers, and exhibitors are all in one location, not to mention food, drink, and other amenities, making it easy to get to where you want to be. There is no commute between different events, no time wasted in traffic, and no need to take multiple Ubers per day.  This February, NFT Paris will be held in the 10,000m<sup >2</sup> Grand Palais iâphi©mi®re, at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, whilst VeeCon 2022 filled up the U.S. Bank Stadium in downtown Minneapolis. (It's worth noting that VeeCon 2023 is three separate locations in Indianapolis, though all within a few hundreds metres of each other.) Outside web3, where conferences have become a refined science, using one location is the obvious choice. Both of these conferences got it right.  A further advantage of tightly-knit conferences is that that in-person networking is much more effective than online networking. At almost every NFT conference I've been to, it is easy to meet people, but central locations make it seamless to start up a conversation because everyone is under the same roof. And meeting people is the entire purpose of a conference: making connections, learning about artists and products, and discussing the future  all without using a meme or an emoji. You may leave exhausted, but you also come out buzzing, full of ideas, and inspired.  Last, the quality of speakers at NFT Paris and VeeCon was exceptional. This is not always the case, and many conferences are guilty of making the most of a handful of top-tier speakers, whilst overall letting the standard drop severely. (At <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/nft-nyc-coverage-3#:~:text=clear%20emphasis%20on%20speaker%20quantity%20over%20quality"">NFT NYC</a>, for example, a tenth of the 15,000 attendees were listed as speakers.) NFT Paris and VeeCon have not fallen into that trap. Last year's most memorable speakers from NFT Paris were Ian Rogers from Ledger, Yat Siu from Animoca Brands, and MetaKovan, who purchased Beeple's  Everydays: the First 5000 Days  for $69m in March 2021. MetaKovan participates in very few interviews; it was a major coup to have him on the agenda and he shared the life lessons he has learnt since buying the world's most expensive NFT, including why, amongst a seemingly endless pool of NFTs, you can only find uniqueness through investing your own time.  At VeeCon, the speakers were equally strong, including Beeple himself, as well as Snoop Dogg, Fewocious, and Pharrell Williams (who works with Doodles as the collection's Chief Brand Officer). However, the segments were short, which led to surface-level insights. At NFT Paris, the talks were longer, panellists had time to debate, and there was deeper audience interaction which made it far more interesting to attend.  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:720px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""720px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63d13b22cdbb6a3ea21eb7f1_wa.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Pharrell Williams spoke at VeeCon 2022. </figcaption></figure> This year it is clear from the speaker roster that NFT Paris is aiming even bigger. As well as welcoming back Ledger's Ian Rogers and Animoca's Yat Siu, NFT Paris is hosting Greg Solano, co-founder of Yuga Labs; Julian Holguin, CEO of Doodles and former President of Billboard; Erick Calderon, founder of ArtBlocks; alongside executives from LVMH, Salesforce, Warner Bros., and Shopify.  The cost of these conferences is also worth mentioning. Conference tickets range from a few hundred dollars to thousands for multi-day events. This excludes flights, accommodation, socialising, and transport. It can be hefty, and last year we saw backlash against several conferences due to pricing. What VeeCon did well is releasing their ticket as an NFT, which let the market determine the value of the three-day event. Tickets initially traded at 2eth but later fell to 0.2eth ($500 at the time). With a month to go until the conference, NFT Paris tickets are ‚Ç¨390 euros for the two-day event, whilst a half-day immersion experience is ‚Ç¨60. While it will still be cost-prohibitive for many people, the value one can gain from attending these conferences is well worth the investment. ",1576

Techno confirms that plan has always been to open up more DAO membership space in order to bring that price down and boost accessibility.  After all, they're trying to create something that's literally for everyone. ""We wanted to build an alternative internet in a way that doesn't give this power to the few, to governments,"" says Techno.""We give this power to the people.""  Not only are governments in charge of information access in today's internet age, with many outright banning websites, social media platforms and other digital pages, but so are a strikingly small number of organisations.

""We think the project should be judged by the essence of the project and not by the people"" behind it, he says, positing that Bitcoin might not have become the force that it is today if its founder's name was known upon its launch.""Too many people would have wanted to attack him personally, and the idea wouldn't stand by itself,"" Techno suggests.  He describes all of the tomi core leaders as""veterans"" in the cryptocurrency and web3 space.

TomiPay, which has multi-chain storing capacity, already boasts 40,000 users, Techno claims.  People who surf the encrypted tomiNet will be able to retain their privacy without handing over their personal data to websites and their advertising partners. TomiNet's builders are exploring a subscription model and, should that come to fruition, Techno says its users will have a safer and  "" sans pop-up ads  "" a more pleasant browsing experience. Those users who are willing to pay monthly for a web browser are promised the freedom to express themselves as long as they're not bad actors  as judged by the DAO of course  and access to more online information, particularly that which has been blocked by governments around the world.  In addition to seeing their ownership stake potentially rise in value, if demand for the tomiNet increases, Pioneer members of the DAO will also be gifted, Techno says, a""sense of importance to their contribution"" to the construction of the free tomiNet. Techno believes that three billion people, from countries like China, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey, Tunisia, and others where freedom is at a premium, should want to use tomiNet from the get-go. ""We will allow web2 platforms to very easily make themselves accessible to people in these regions,"" Techno says.""If Chinese people want to use Facebook or YouTube they will be able to. We can encrypt their IP addresses and make it accessible to Chinese customers without allowing the Chinese government to block them.""  He says tomi is in talks with""mega content creators,"" both individuals and""big companies that create news,"" for partnerships. He notes that interest in reaching internet users from countries where censorship is ubiquitous, to varying degrees, has been high. As is his own interest.""People go to places with content,"" Techno reflects.""If I have the best tech and I don't have content, then no one wants to use it.""  Tomi's DAO fund now boasts $11 million, which Techno says is strictly for""investing in the ecosystem."" There are a hundred or so people working on tomiNet, he says, in eight different countries: as well as China and Pakistan, they herald from Brazil, Estonia, Switzerland, Switzerland, the UK, and the US. Some clock in remotely, while others report to one of tomi's offices, located across the world. ""It will take some time to build,"" Techno says,""like the internet took time""  with its flaws it may be.  Techno and his compatriots have built tomiNet to thrive indefinitely. The DAO means that he leaders, who, as Techno points out,""won't live a thousand years,"" are replaceable, as their own replacements will be. Tomi's leaders will, thus, always have to remain""on their toes"" and""do a good job,"" Techno says, or else the DAO can vote them out.

How web3 gave Maciej Drabik the tools to build a life of creativity,how web3 gave maciej drabik the tools to build a life of creativity,Tue Feb 07 2023 11:33:19,Maciej Drabik has always poured his emotions into his art. But it remained only a hobby until he discovered NFTs. He speaks to Nina Knaack Knaack about how web3 gave value to his creativity.,Tue Feb 07 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Illustration; Animation; 3d-Art; POla Kalejayend; Europe,Nina Knaack," Maciej discovered 3D art when he was just 15, and knew at once that he longed to master the artform himself. Slowly, he began to develop his skills as a self-taught artist: a journey which was accompanied by one of self-discovery. But life took a different path and Maciej pursued a career in advertising. Although he was able to create art in his spare time, this was no longer enough for him.  After ten years in the industry, the pull to return to his childhood passion became overwhelming enough to persuade Maciej to make a change. He left his job in the commercial agency industry and found a career in which he could use illustration, 3D art, and animation.""I realised how much I missed the actual creative process and switched to making illustrations and doing visual effects for films, tv, and games full-time,"" he recalls.  Maciej sees his work as a reflection of his emotions and a form of self-therapy. Each piece serves as a journal, a testament to the feelings and events that he wants to process.""For me, creating 3D animations is a way to express the emotions that I want to get out of my system, whether happiness or anger,"" he explains.""By putting these feelings into a piece of art, I process the events that produced it."" In doing so, Maciej hopes that his work will not only touch his viewers, but also help them to recognise their own emotions in his art. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center"" style=""padding-bottom:82%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""82%"" data-rt-dimensions=""240:328"" data-page-url=""https://vimeo.com/796639970""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/796639970"" title=""Rainy Day in Metal City, by Maciej Drabik""></iframe> </figure> Since Maciej's emotions form the roots of his art, his body of work is extremely diverse.""Sometimes I just create for pure entertainment, but on another day, I can strongly feel that I need to address a certain, serious topic,"" he says.  As for his style, Maciej's work is a distinctive and eclectic synthesis of comic books, CGI-animations, retro sci-fi art, and baroque paintings. Ultimately, style is a means to an end for Maciej.""My main goal is to have fun while creating visual arts,"" he explains.""Being able to actually play around is what I love most about making autonomous work.""  Maciej's day job continues to shape his skills and allows him to evolve as an artist. Working with other artisans has given him invaluable insight, which he incorporates into his personal work.""I am learning a lot by working with highly skilled professionals, artists, and directors. It is incredible to be able to witness how others make visual effects for movies, TV shows, or game cinematics. It definitely helps my own artistic practice evolve faster.""  However, until 2020, Maciej never imagined that his personal,""autonomous"" work could be valuable. Creating art and sharing it online was just a hobby, and the things that he produced were very different from""a painting in a gallery."" This changed when he began to support his friend Dutchtide's <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/midnightbreeze"" > Midnight Breeze </a>   project, a series of 130 anime-style dreamscapes that has since traded almost 4,000 eth in volume.  After this noteworthy introduction to NFTs, Maciej's web3 journey took off properly, with his work getting picked up quickly by collectors such as Norcal, Artifaction, and Dave Krugman. Maciej began minting his work with zero followers on Twitter, and without busying himself with any marketing.  His fanbase gathered themselves organically, which, for Maciej, is even more of an incentive to continue creating.""My goal is to repeatedly surprise and amaze my collectors with new and original ideas,"" he says.  Drawing inspiration from the broad scope of his emotions, as well as the things that he encounters in his daily life, the creative process comes naturally to Maciej.""I strongly believe that visual artists are great observers and can make visual connections between a lot of things that are often not obvious. I try to give an outside perspective to my viewer,"" he explains.  For Maciej, each of his creations are uniquely valuable.""I have a sentiment for every artwork I have ever created,"" he shares.""They are like pages in an old calendar and remind me of how I felt and where I was at a certain moment in my life.""  One work in particular holds a particular importance for Maciej, however: his <a href=""https://maciejdrabik.com/projects/Ye1z0b"" > Death Loop </a> collection, a series of three animated, looped artworks, showing the recurrences in which those who battle with addiction are trapped.   ""I rediscovered the pure joy of creativity.""    Maciej Drabik  ""I made this series during my own rehab process and have been brutally honest in the animations,"" Maciej discloses.""It shows my own struggles while working on the issues I had. Making this collection helped me to say farewell to substance abuse, and hopefully it can help others as well.""  Though he goes by the moniker Negative Vibrations', Maciej does not want to be limited to negative themes. Through his art, Maciej shares the message with others that they are not alone in their struggles, building his work on the hope that people can find solace in that thought. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:755px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""755px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63e5053996482a2510c22b33_ezgif.com-optimize.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://knownorigin.io/gallery/517300-death-loop-desk""> Death Loop, Desk </a> , by Maciej Drabik. </figcaption></figure> Above all, perhaps, participating in web3 and its cryptoart scene has inspired Maciej himself.""I was living in the bubble of a concept artist for a long time,"" he explains. Before finding cryptoart, this is all that Maciej had envisioned himself doing, yet, by becoming a hub for digital artists around the world, the web3 art scene has become a truly inspirational place for artists like himself. ""In the NFT space, I rediscovered the pure joy of creativity by looking at new styles and aesthetics,"" he recalls.""It reminded me to keep pushing myself to look for different ways to tell my stories to the world.""  Maciej sees web3 as a chance to focus more on centring his life around creativity.""Through my art sales, I can fund bigger personal projects, like making my own animation film,"" he says.""I want to take the time to make things that have never been done before and now I have the luxury to be able to do that.""

How web3 is empowering a disability movement,how web3 is empowering a disability movement,Wed Jun 29 2022 21:25:30,"From beds and behind screen readers, with nothing more than an internet connection. Mariquita de Boissiere Philippa de Boissii®re speaks to the disabled Lea Rose Emeryders who are setting new standards in web3, explores how blockchain can usher in new heights in accessibility, charts the evolution of disability justice from web2 to web3.",Fri Jul 01 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Communities-augmented,Disability; Equality,Mariquita de Boissiere," As hoodies and newly-doxed faces flew into New York for NFT NYC last month, a far smaller group of sharp-suited delegates and the representatives of well-connected NGOs flew out after attending the United Nation's conference on disability rights. While officials gear up to continue discussions back home, disabled people from across borders and time zones continue to tackle the issues that affect them, collectively, across the blockchain.  Nonetheless, this did not discourage representatives from 185 countries coming together to further an agenda of inclusion for disabled people, formally known as the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. But with an implicit emphasis on <a href=""https://leavingevidence.wordpress.com/2011/02/12/changing-the-framework-disability-justice/"">independence and individualism</a>, set against a backdrop of austerity politics that has pervaded much of the world since the annual conference was established in 2008, the UN process has been criticised for its limited success in improving the material conditions and levels of access for the <a href=""https://www.who.int/teams/noncommunicable-diseases/sensory-functions-disability-and-rehabilitation/world-report-on-disability"">hundreds of millions</a> of people around the world chronically impacted across a range of physical, mental, sensorial, or psychiatric conditions.  Between liberated zones and encoded ableism  Malicious Sheep, a Canadian non-binary artist and disability justice activist, has no intention of waiting through years of UN conventions for change, or""trying fruitlessly to reform systems of power which uphold, enforce, and maintain prejudicial oppression."" Instead, they perceive, in web3, ""a more effective avenue for change,"" one that provides a model which""institutions will follow in time.""  Disability justice first emerged as a framework in 2005, within the context of web2 and its emerging shift towards user-generated content and social media. Patty Berne, one of the early founders, cites the emergence of new online""liberated zones"" as a catalyst for an new upsurge of activism, but, writing in <a href=""https://www.sinsinvalid.org/blog/disability-justice-a-working-draft-by-patty-berne"">2015</a>, they note that disability justice is still an emerging concept.""In many ways, disability justice is a nascent framework that some call a movement, still identifying the we'."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62bccc9cdf4d202a49a7dac1_Malicious%20Sheep%20photography.jpg"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" > <figcaption > Photography by Malicious Sheep </figcaption></figure> While this new iteration of the internet represented important gains for the disabled community, it also created new barriers. TheUberhuman, who describes himself as""possibly the only deaf founder in web3"", notes the reluctance of news and social media platforms to incorporate live captioning as a major and long-standing barrier to access.""In web2 we moved to this video era of social media, and it took 10 years to give us captions. On YouTube, I still have to wait eighteen hours for a breaking news video to be captioned. By the time I get to see it, it's old news.""  TheUberhuman argues that the proprietary nature of web2 was instrumental in the internet's failure to live up to Tim Berners-Lee's founding vision of universal access. His project, <a href=""https://twitter.com/DeafHandzNFT"">DeafHandzNFT</a>, aims to bridge the gap between hearing and deaf communities by encouraging hearing communities to engage with sign language, whilst engaging the disabled community in a venture to co-develop the AI tools to digitise and translate sign language in real-time.  Examining the promise of web2 internet-based digital technology to open up the world to people with disabilities, academics Katie Ellis and Mike Kent argue that the concentration of power within the walled gardens of Big Tech companies, such as Apple and Microsoft, led to deviations from accessibility standards.""Digital technology is often constructed in the same social world that people with disability are routinely disabled by."" Consequently, they add,""there exists a false perception amongst designers that accessibility represents a restriction on creativity."" In practice, a universal design approach can aim for accessibility across the broadest range of needs and characteristics, and when it is, it can be beneficial even for users without disabilities. For Ellis and Kent, despite the difficulties, ""technology is the last best hope for accessibility.""   ""As a disabled person, that's made a huge difference. It's just mind-blowing.""

With this, can web3 address the accessibility shortcomings that were common across web2?  Synkitty, a disabled Australian mixed-media artist, has been responding precisely to this question. Drawing upon personal and collective experiences of disability, she has led the production of best practices guidelines in a web3 context. Malicious Sheep, a fellow contributor, explains that the guidelines contemplate accessibility across web3""from exchange to wallet to marketplace,"" and are a landmark contribution towards ensuring a truly inclusive web3.  What is perhaps even more striking is how access to unmediated, borderless, peer-to-peer networks is creating access to resources and facilitating collaboration on levels previously unseen both between and within historically marginalised communities. <a href=""https://teia.art/about"" >Teia</a>, the community-owned NFT platform, offered Synkitty the opportunity to bypass the barriers she faced from traditional galleries as a disabled artist. For the first time, she was able to connect directly with collectors.""As a disabled person, that's made a huge difference. It's just mind-blowing. There are often extra healthcare bills we have to cover; many of us need carers.

Bobby, who began experimenting with AI art in response to a degenerative condition, soon realised that through NFTs, she had the opportunity to support local communities often faced with social discrimination. Their Eden Project <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/transparadise"">collection</a> was created to support Unit 2, a safe space for trans and two-spirit communities in Toronto.   TheUberhuman is clear about the broader implications of these shifts. ""Web3 has the capacity to really disrupt society as we know it."" On one hand, he foresees how""accessibility is going to be a new competitive edge for businesses,"" creating large revenue streams for businesses who build tools and interfaces that serve deaf and otherwise disabled communities. The idea is that with videos stored on the blockchain, serving them to consumers will be a myriad of mini YouTube's, some of which will be built around user experiences tailored to disabled communities, rather than on a single behemoth that believes it has bigger fish to fry.  He also anticipates an altered socio-political chemistry, driven by a spectrum of neurodivergent approaches to problem-solving.""Web3 has given me an opportunity to really step into my identity as a deaf person and own it in a way that I hadn't before,"" he explains.""It has allowed me to bring people into the world that I live in and suddenly it's like, oh, I don't have to keep up with you, you have to keep up with me'.""  The extent to which disability justice, which sees itself as an explicitly anti-capitalist movement, can find expression within web3 remains to be seen. To some, web3 has already rushed too far in the direction of financialisation, but the vision for the movement articulated by Mia Mingus, another early founder of the movement, chimes with the disabled-led transformations already seeded on the blockchain. In <a href=""https://leavingevidence.wordpress.com/2011/02/12/changing-the-framework-disability-justice/"">2010</a>, she imagined a world""where our organising and activism is less segregated, where our movements and communities are accessible and don't participate in the isOla Kalejayetion of disabled communities. I imagine places where we fight for whole and connected people, families and communities.""  What could society look like as the multiple barriers that enforce segregation are dismantled or coded out of existence? Malicious Sheep argues that""our disabilities and neuro-divergencies are part of who we are, but it is not all we are  "" it is simply brought to the foreground of our existence because of barriers and prejudice. Our survival depends on it. The antonym to disable is not able, it is  en able. We are disabled by society, the onus is not on us. Anyone at any time could become disabled, so it is in our collective interest to unpack our internalised and externalised ableism to move forward into web3."" ",3089
Charity's Next Generation of Donors gets Unlocked with Web3,how web3 is fostering a new generation of givers,Wed Mar 01 2023 13:34:58,"The demographics of giving are changing, with younger donors who increasingly identify as philanthropists donating more, and more often, than past generations. This new wave of donors coincides with major adopters of blockchain-based web3 technologies, presenting an opportunity to engage a particularly generous and dedicated donor base.
",Wed Mar 01 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Community-society,Charity; Giving-Platforms; Crypto-Donation,Nick," Considered one of the greatest chess grandmasters of all time, Gary Kasparov has long made the blockchain a significant part of his operations as chair of the Human Rights Foundation, accepting Bitcoin donations as far back as 2014  well before cryptocurrency had become a household name.  This man, tasked with always thinking a dozen steps ahead, has a history of recognising the next trends in technology, and a willingness to grapple with it, as he famously did when becoming the first world champion to lose a chess match to a computer in 1997. And when it comes to the philanthropy world, it has been clear to Kasparov for some time that web3 will continue to be a powerful tool for empowering individuals and organisations alike. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2186px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2186px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63ff602c2865c9dbf3fd58b1_Screenshot%202023-03-01%20at%2014.24.33.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > The Human Rights Foundation has been accepting Bitcoin donations since 2014. </figcaption></figure>""Cryptocurrencies become an inseparable part of our progress, because the whole world is moving digital,"" he told <a href=""https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/03/garry-kasparov-crypto-means-freedom/"" > CoinDesk </a>   last year.""And if the economy becomes more digital, so does the money.""  The Human Rights Foundation used to be an outlier in the charity sector, but this is no longer: major nonprofits, including UNICEF, American Cancer Society, and WaterAid, are not just accepting cryptocurrencies, but testing other ways to use the blockchain to enhance their operations  with Save the Children beginning to do so at around the same time as HRF.  The Giving Block helps more than 2,000 non-profits fundraise cryptocurrency donations and other noncash digital assets. It reports that more than 200""blue chip"" charities, those operating with annual budgets surpassing $100 million, are already on the crypto giving platform.  Yes, they now have access to a truly global donor pool in this interconnected world, but they must also compete for attention with a world of nonprofits. That dynamic creates enormous potential for charities that can stand out online, but also a significant downside for those that do not (consider that 86% of donors <a href=""https://enthuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Enthuse_Donor_Pulse_Summer_2021.pdf"" >give to three charities or fewer</a> each year).  Reaching this new giver demographic may be challenging, but""web3 is the biggest skeleton key for getting non-profits access to a younger donor demographic,"" says Pat Duffy, co-founder of The Giving Block.  Doing so is particularly valuable for charities, considering that cryptocurrency donors are, in general, a particularly generous group  in 2020, nearly half (45%) of <a href=""https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/about-us/news/growing-popularity-of-cryptocurrency-could-fuel-charitable-giving.html"" >cryptocurrency</a> owners (which comprise a full fifth of the US population and a tenth of Europe's) donated more than $1,000 to charity, well above the portion of non-crypto investors doing the same (33%).  Recognising the immense potential for web3 tech to enhance community building, transparency, and efficiency in the charitable sector, these blue chip charities have myriad reasons for welcoming digital currencies. Most of all, they understand that these technologies are driving the future of giving  and that by implementing them early, they can unlock a new generation of donors. ""Charities must make sure to operate in community spaces, and those communities are moving online,"" says Linda McBain, Chief Digital Officer at Save the Children UK.""The challenge is asking how do we show up there,' to really engage with that digital audience.""   It all starts with understanding who that digital audience is. Over the past decade, philanthropic trends have shifted in several meaningful ways, particularly as millennials have become the single largest demographic of givers.  Millennials are more likely to identify as philanthropists. <a href=""https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/content/dam/fc-public/docs/resources/2021-future-of-philanthropy-summary.pdf"" >Three-quarters</a> of American millennials identify as philanthropists  compared to just half of the American population writ large. And this phenomenon is not relegated to the United States. In the <a href=""https://enthuse.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Enthuse_Donor_Pulse_Summer_2021.pdf"" >United Kingdom,</a> 81% of those under the age of 40 donated to charities in 2021, which compares to a mere 62% of those aged 40 and above.  While younger generations donate more, they do so online. Nearly three quarters of millennials <a href=""https://www.zellepay.com/sites/default/files/2020-09/Consumer_Payment_Behaviors.pdf"" >made a charitable donation in 2020</a>, a higher portion than any other generation, and nearly half of those who donated <a href=""https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/content/dam/fc-public/docs/resources/2021-future-of-philanthropy-summary.pdf"" >did so online</a>.   ""The tangible thing we have seen from web3 is that it is raising millions of dollars.""    Linda McBain, Chief Digital Officer, Save the Children UK   Finally, millennials are likely to expect transparency and accountability. Fidelity Charitable found that 66% of millennials said that they actively tracked the results of the non-profits they supported, compared to just 40% of Gen Xers and 32% of baby boomers.""Younger donors view a donation as an investment in a solution to a problem they see,"" Fidelity Charitable concluded in its <a href=""https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/content/dam/fc-public/docs/resources/2021-future-of-philanthropy-summary.pdf"" >2021 Future of Philanthropy report</a>.  In essence, the new generation of givers is not satisfied with simply sitting out on the sidelines while nonprofits take care of the rest: they want to play an active role. Charities have a tremendous opportunity to engage with the community, but they also face significant challenges to harness that energy.  On top of this, charities often find that this demographic differs from their typical donor pool, meaning that nonprofits that accept cryptocurrencies don't just shift to giving online, but actually create a new well to draw from. ""The audience is totally different from our core donor base: it is skewed male, and it's younger,"" Linda says of the communities that Save the Children has been able to access since they began accepting crypto donations.""We are also seeing donations coming from countries where we don't have such a significant brand presence, but where donors may have found us through our engagement with web3 communities."" But how can charities better engage with web3 communities? <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2250px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2250px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63ff61097c601c6649e7784f_children.webp"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Save the Children began accepting cryptocurrency donations in 2013. </figcaption></figure> Education is one answer. According to Fidelity Charitable,""more than one-in-three cryptocurrency investors (38%) are not aware that selling digital assets is a taxable event. Similarly, there is significant confusion about donating these assets to charity."" They note that a""tax-savvy strategy"" to minimise the investor's tax burden can include donating crypto assets directly to charity, though most people are not aware that this is an option.  Non-profits that want to access youngers givers will not just need to be crypto savvy, they'll need to be able to explain to millennials how their crypto assets can be used to donate, and the benefits of doing so. For those that can make the shift, the rewards are large. ""The tangible thing we have seen from web3 is that it is raising millions of dollars,"" Linda says.""That goes directly to our programming and changes children's lives for the better."" Save the Children raised more than $5 million in crypto donations in 2021, whilst their 2022 <a href=""https://www.digitalnationaus.com.au/news/weareukraine-nfts-raise-funds-for-save-the-children-and-women-for-women-international-583869"">#WeAreUkraine</a> NFT fundraiser helped bolster the charity's efforts to help families most impacted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The illustrator turned digital painter says she takes an improvisational approach when it comes to creating her images, despite an output that never fails to feel perfectly composed. Ultimately, what matters is ensuring that the emotions and energy of her initial sketches carry through to the final image.""I never know how a painting will end up looking and that's what excites me,"" she says.""The first marks are instinctive, the rest is discovery.""  While much of her work has evolved from her self-taught lessons as a freelance illustrator, she attributes a non-negligible portion of her style to portraiture, and an instructor who encouraged her to take more risks.""My art is a constant balance of the sensitive and the bold,"" she explains.""Erratic, passionate brushstrokes next to the gentlest and most honest lines.""  Now one of the few artists who can say she has auctioned work at the legendary Christie's auction house, goldcat found her first artistic influences dotted around her grandmother's apartment. Her grandmother was married first to an artist, then to an art collector, meaning that the space was invariably filled with various paintings and sculptures. Although she never quite understood them, the works left an indelible mark on goldcat who, though born in Germany, was raised in Kenya. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3679px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3679px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63cac7e7a0c79ffa8b113561_he%20poet.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/the-poet-41891"" > The Poet </a> , a figurative digital painting by goldcat. </figcaption></figure> goldcat remembers creating art without intentionality early on. Indeed, she recalls travelling to university one day and realising she had lost her entire art portfolio. A bad omen, she thought at the time. University was followed by""a few years of business classes and depressing jobs,"" which eventually saw her discover fantasy illustration. She was 27 at the time, and decided to swap the boardroom for the stylus. Well, not quite. She wrote a business plan for herself, and never looked back. Omen overcome.  goldcat's interest in digital painting was born partly out of necessity. Working from the tiny desk in her bedroom, the medium was the only artistic outlet that did not require more space, time, or money than she had available. It was certainly enough for her to begin her career as a illustrator.   ""I cherish those who focus on what can't be taken away.""     goldcat   goldcat cut her teeth as a freelancer for just shy of half a decade, illustrating game assets and book covers. It was good work that allowed her to refine her craft, but soon grew stale.""I loved the freelance life, but the jobs increasingly bored me,"" she notes, recalling the signal to switch pursuits. Resolving to find more creative fulfillment, goldcat decided to dive headfirst into the ultra-competitive, but closely-related, world of concept art. Soon after, in February 2021, she discovered NFTs.  Having seen a couple of her illustrator friends use the hashtag #nft on Instagram, goldcat became curious about the new subculture she saw emerging on social media. Like most, she was initially confused by this niche art movement, though that confusion quickly gave way to intrigue. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3230px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3230px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63cac7f7116aa3a52b180e68_I%20imagine.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/241232"" > I Imagine </a> , goldcat's dark art piece featuring in Objkt's  hic et nunc  collection. </figcaption></figure> There was one minor complication however. A staunch environmentalist, the Ethereum network that hosted, and continues to host, the lion's share of NFTs was too energy intensive in 2021 for goldcat's liking. Those concerns, alongside Ethereum's high transaction costs at the time, drove goldcat to an alternative smart contract blockchain in Tezos, which had used an energy-efficient proof-of-stake mechanism since launching in 2018.  By the time that she was minting art on the Tezos blockchain, goldcat had found many more reasons to stay than just its higher energy efficiency.""I really enjoyed the vibe among Tezos artists too,"" she explains.""It wasn't collector-focused but artist-focused, so the culture was very chill and experimentative, which, in my eyes, is perfect for art to thrive.""  Since then, of course, Ethereum has adopted a similar proof-of-stake mechanism, taking its energy consumption to <a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/energy-consumption/"">less than that of a typical global corporation</a>, like PayPal. That makes Ethereum justifiable in goldcat's mind, though for now she admits that the Tezos art scene has captured her heart.  Due to the timing of her entrance into web3, goldcat has held a front-row seat to both the breathless euphoria of the 2021 bull market, which saw art sales flying largely off the strength of speculative trading, and the despair of the following year's bear market, when that came to a dramatic halt. It has been a particular challenge for the artistic community, many of whom have been forced to return to the types of salaried jobs they had hoped to leave behind.  That is not to say that the bear market was all bad, mind. Aside from some personal, professional milestones, goldcat has seen those who have remained in the space coalesce around a more authentic and sustainable mindset, freed of the speculative pressure that left the web3 space quicker than anything else. As she explains,""The Wagmi culture has disappeared. There are fewer get-rich-quick projects and founders, and we can all now tell who is genuine.""  Still, goldcat suggests that the material pressure of lower sales and interest across the market has made artistic camaraderie a rarer sight.""So much hope died along with the bull market, and the bitterness can be draining at times,"" she laments.""I cherish those who focus on what can't be taken away: the love for art, the exchange of it, and personal as well as artistic growth."" goldcat hopes that artists take heed of their bear market lessons, and put them into practice during the next bull cycle.  There are other things that she hopes for moving forward: that the NFT art market can separate itself from the cryptocurrency price action; that artists take a longer-term approach to their work rather than worrying about individual drops; and that artists band together to create the things they want to see in the space rather than, in her words,""wishing for them to appear magically.""  No matter the challenges that NFT artists are facing at the moment, goldcat urges a focus on the fundamentals that drew artists to the space in droves in the first place.""I was and still am absolutely convinced that digital ownership is a huge deal and an unequaled opportunity for artists like me.""

The Malian native is a powerhouse of creative energy; finding outlets in music, photography, acting, modelling, activism, and philanthropy.  It's a dizzying ri©sumi©, but Inna's story has a simple beginning: a love of music, and the happy coincidence of living on the same street as one of Mali's most famous musicians, Salif Keita.""Nobody in my family is a musician,"" says Inna.""So, I wanted to find people who could teach me."" Aged 14, she walked down the street to knock on Salif's door, introduce herself, and ask to learn.""I knew that he was mentoring some other young people,"" she recalls,""and he took me under his wing.""  Inna honed her craft in the years that followed  "" finding influences from traditional Malian music, desert blues, hip-hop, jazz and R&amp;B, and of course, rock ""I was a rock-head!"" she laughs. Moving to France to pursue her music career as a teenager, Inna completed her university studies and soon after signed to Warner Music Group.""I wanted to find a sound that was mine,"" she recalls.""Being a young African woman in a modern world, I wanted to know what that would sound like."" Singing in French, English, and her native Bambara, Inna's albums are a kaleidoscope of different musical styles and instruments; each release is an evolution of sound and content, but always inflected with her own distinctive sensibilities. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1400px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1400px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63865a5fd6d5ec4d6f8e94a4_1_PkIvDBhty8imY5o4-jumnA.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Inna Modja is as well-versed in web2 as she is in web3. The Malian artist, once signed to Warner Bros.' record label, worked with organisations like the UN as a climate activist before moving into web3, where she is a key contributor to World of Women and Rug Radio. </figcaption></figure> Alongside her musical versatility, Inna's creative pursuits have grown increasingly diverse as her work in photography and film has drawn attention. If there is one unifying theme that runs through all of Inna's projects, it is a belief in the power of narrative.""It's storytelling with my music, with my photography, with my films. It's storytelling, always,"" she says.""I like to bring people into a story, to share something that I'm passionate about or that I truly believe in. I think that is what gives meaning to everything that I do.""   ""I didn't want to be a UN ambassador who would just use their voice.""    Inna Modja   Indeed, her most ambitious project to date is outside the arts almost completely: her 2019 documentary film,  The Great Green Wall . Produced by renowned Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles, the project saw Inna travelling across the breadth of Africa: from Senegal in the west to Djibouti in the east. Throughout the documentary, the line of her journey is guided by a living wall of freshly planted trees, a green wall tracing an 8000km path through many of the communities most at risk from climate change. Sharing and exchanging music as she travels, the film's narrative highlights the rich cultural traditions and human stories that lie in jeopardy. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""56.206088992974244%"" data-rt-dimensions=""854:480"" data-page-url=""https://youtu.be/kB1qK_yBVxU""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/kB1qK_yBVxU"" title=""THE GREAT GREEN WALL TRAILER""></iframe> </figure>""With that documentary, we wanted to create a movement that is global,"" Inna says.""We are firm believers that art with advocacy, activism, and philanthropy is really something that can create powerful movements."" In the years since its release, the project has been a catalyst for action, raising over<a href=""https://www.unccd.int/news-stories/multimedia/great-green-wall-implementation-report"" > $19 billion</a> through the UN to""construct the largest living structure on the planet"" and restore dilapidating landscapes across the Sahel.

I wanted to actively be part of the project  "" to go in the field and meet people, understand what they're going through, try to find solutions, and work with them.""  That solution-oriented mindset is what led Inna and her husband, Marco Conti Sikic, also an artist, to begin exploring web3 in early 2020. Locked down at home with a three-month-old baby, the couple initially became interested in the rapidly-developing NFT art scene before identifying the technology's potential to offer transformative new avenues for activism and philanthropy. ""For fundraising, it is incredible,"" Inna says.""It's faster and more efficient because as you raise funds and awareness, you create a strong community."" Not only does web3 facilitate community building, but Inna sees organisational structures like DAOs offering increased financial transparency, accountability, and a radical rebalancing between individual agency and collective action.""I love when people's voices are heard, and in this space, when you hold a token your voice is heard. You are part of a community, part of this bigger entity, but also, as an individual, you count.""

Inside the company revitalising legacy TV with web3,inside the company revitalising legacy tv with web3,Fri Feb 03 2023 11:16:43,"TV studios are exploring how they can use NFTs to invigorate their legacy IP. Greg Larson speaks to Tony Pearce to discover how Reality+ are giving Doctor Who and Thunderbirds new Lea Rose Emeryses of life in web3. For Doctor Who, it's a chance to grow the world's longest sci-fi series. For Thunderbirds, NFTs are breathing new energy into a show that stopped rolling in the 1960s.",Fri Feb 03 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Games; Brands; Tv; Intellectual-Property; Applications,Greg Larson," For most of the world, the heat around NFTs has dwindled since their dizzying heights in late 2021. But as hype wanes, notable brands in the entertainment industry, fashion, and beyond are exploring how the technology can revitalise and augment intellectual property that has begun to accumulate dust. From beloved TV franchises to luxury clothing lines, these brands may find that NFTs are their best tool for re-engaging consumers and bringing new life to their existing IP.  Tony Pearce is the co-founder and CEO of <a href=""https://realityplus.com/"" >Reality+</a>, a web3 studio that has created activations with the likes of Doctor Who and Thunderbirds. He argues that, when NFTs provide original utility, they can help IP owners access younger consumers.""A lot of these companies have huge fanbases and a ton of existing IP, but they're struggling to find new ways of engaging those fans and bringing life to their franchises,"" he explains.""By introducing NFTs, they can give fans a new way to interact with their favourite characters and keep the franchise relevant.""  Pearce knows first-hand how this new brand strategy can play out. Working with the BBC to launch Doctor Who, the world's longest running sci-fi TV series, into web3, Reality+ introduced a new line of NFT trading cards, featuring characters and scenes from the series.   The <a href=""https://doctorwho-worldsapart.com/"" >Doctor Who: Worlds Apart</a> digital trading card game allows players to travel through space and time, build a deck of 50 cards using a combination of companions, creatures, objects, and more from all corners of the universe, and engage in intense player vs player battles. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63dcfb7eb7d6c6011a918d4f_ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Doctor Who: Worlds Apart is a digital card trading game, produced by Reality+. </figcaption></figure> The BBC recognised several key advantages for making these digital trading cards, 2 million of which have already sold on the Reality+ marketplace. Firstly, each NFT card is a verifiably unique digital asset, which allows fans to gain a sense of ownership in the Doctor Who universe, which was first seen on screen in 1963.  And whilst that in itself could be done on a centralised app, the advantage of blockchain is that it gives fans the opportunity to buy and sell coveted cards on third-party marketplaces like OpenSea, as well as letting other organisations integrate the data about who owns what into their own applications, giving players further opportunities beyond playing Worlds Apart. Overall, as NFTs, these digital trading cards permit fans to play the trading card game whilst holding their very own slice of the Doctor Who universe.  With Thunderbirds, Reality+ are taking their web3 ambitions to higher heights. In many ways, it also represents a starker challenge. Whereas Doctor Who continues to enjoy cultural popularity, particularly in the UK, Thunderbirds ran for just two seasons in the 1960s, remaining an admittedly fondly-remembered footnote in British pop culture. Leveraging the Thunderbirds IP owned by ITV, Reality+ built a Thunderbirds metaverse with <a href=""https://www.sandbox.game/en/"" >The Sandbox</a>, in an effort to take an old creative property and accelerate it into the 21st century.  Taking inspiration from the TV show, NFT holders can join the <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/thunderbirds-international-rescue-club-fab"" >Thunderbirds International Rescue Club</a>, which is dedicated to saving lives through a series of daring missions, executed using a fleet of futuristic vehicles set in the 2060s. Holding a Thunderbirds NFT will grant owners access to a unique section of the Sandbox metaverse, where players can participate in new rescue missions and explore the Thunderbirds' base on Tracy Island in a way that has never been seen before. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63dcfd3ebfc2a32fe7142881_tb2.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xd7fbff0fd48de02901e19b192cc59b1c31198526/1240"" > Thunderbirds #1240 </a> . These NFTs, which can be purchased on OpenSea, give holders access to the Thunderbirds International Rescue Club, as well as exclusive parts of the Sandbox metaverse.  </figcaption></figure> However, as Pearce notes, success in NFTs is not just about capitalising on a recognisable brand; collections like Nickelodeon have not only failed to capture the imagination of their community in the wake of poorly thought through collections, but tarnished the brand. As with any activation initiative, it is critical to understand the audience in order to create a seamless and fulfilling integration between the NFTs themselves and the overall franchise experience.  In the case of Worlds Apart, the NFTs not only provide fans with collectibles, but those collectibles also enhance the gameplay by providing bonuses and special abilities. This highlights the importance of creating an ecosystem that is not based on financial gain, but, rather, providing actual value and enjoyment for players.  Using NFTs in branding is not without its challenges. NFTs present brands with unique technological and cultural hurdles in creating viable NFT projects. Brands must either develop in-house expertise or find an external team to fill knowledge gaps in web3 promotion, blockchain infrastructure, and understanding how to design truly innovative NFT experiences.   ""NFTs can change how we interact with our favourite franchises.""    Tony Pearce, Co-founder of Reality+   Further, understanding the cultural landscape and what succeeds in web3 is a skillset all of its own. Brands that invest in building internal competency in these areas will be better equipped to create engaging experiences in web3. However, it will not always be necessary or financially viable for brands to host all of those skills in-house. Outsourcing to experienced studios can be a lucrative entri©e into the world of web3, as well as an effective strategy longer term.  In order to harness the full potential of NFTs, brands must delve deeper than a cursory understanding of blockchain technology and marketplaces, all while staying true to their original IP. As Tony Pearce puts it,""NFTs can change how we interact with our favourite franchises  franchises that have been around for decades  and make them new again."" ",1959
Inside the web3 fan groups transforming pro sports,inside the web3 fan groups transforming pro sports,Thu Jan 19 2023 14:45:48,"Web3 presents an opportunity to reinvent how fans interact with their passions, not Lea Rose Emeryst in sport, where teams are finding new ways to bring fans into the action. David Harrington explores how teams from motorsports to sailing are finding new opportunities in web3.
",Thu Jan 19 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Communities-augmented,Sport; Daos,David," Sports is not just a game any more, especially when it comes to web3. Athletes, teams, and leagues are quickly becoming some of the most significant cultural figures to embrace the blockchain, introducing dynamic applications that all consumer-facing brands can take inspiration from.  At the heart of the dovetail between sports and web3 are innovative approaches that completely transform the relationship between fans and athletes. Whether it be a ticket connected to an NFT that provides exclusive opportunities, or a community allocating shared resources to propel up-and-coming athletes into the big leagues, the way that fans engage is changing  for good. ""The conversation in web2 generally goes in one direction,"" says Vasu Kulkarni, Managing Partner at the venture capital firm, Courtside Ventures, where he has been investing in the sports industry since 2016.""Teams and leagues produce, and fans consume.""  Kulkarni looks to web3 to augment that dynamic.""Web3 really has a chance to open things up, rewarding fans in more meaningful ways, and giving them more ownership over their experiences."" These claims are far from conjecture: web3 technologies are already being used to have an impact on sports and fandom. From sailing to motorsports, the sports industry is using web3 to energise supporters, create deeper and bi-directional connections between teams, athletes, and fans, and let those fans feel more like real insiders.  Turning passionate fans into insiders   Peter Miller has had a fascination with cars and motorsports since before he was a teenager, and vividly recalls watching Formula 1 as a child.""I was wrenching on cars when I was four years old, and my dad and I built a Studebaker in our garage when I was in high school,"" Miller recalls.  After graduating from Stanford and going on to found a patent law firm, he saw an opportunity to apply web3 to motorsports and build something that would transform passionate supporters like himself into fans, in a way that would have a real impact. ""We watched crypto gain massive momentum in 2021,"" he continues.""Web3 culture was all about communities coming together and working on big things. In my mind, there was a future where communities came together to be part owners of an F1 team, be involved with NASCAR, and help launch new drivers."" GarageXYZ is the result of that imagination: an NFT-gated community of at most 500 holders, whose members actively take part in discovering, funding, and managing drivers at the top tiers of a sport that they love.  On the seas as on the track, SailGP provides another example of what web3 offers sports communities. The international sailing competition has recently built the Bermuda and Caribbean team as the first fan-owned team in professional yachting. Token holders vote on key team decisions, gain rewards based on the team's success, and have access to unique fan experiences, like being able to talk to sailing team members during a race. ""You can obviously reward fans with discounts, collectibles, or money in web2,"" acknowledges Tod Reynolds, SailGP's Director of Web3 Strategy,""but the data is often siloed across different platforms and you need to trust whoever is giving you those customer stats.""   ""Web3 lets you access data in a much more transparent way.""    Tod Reynolds, Director of Web3 Strategy, SailGP   Web3 transforms that dynamic, with customer behaviour and interactions occurring on the blockchain, public and un-tamperable, for all to see.""Web3 lets you access and work with data in a much more efficient and transparent way,"" he explains.""It's easier to reward and engage your most loyal and passionate fans.""  Making collectibles useful   GarageXYZ and SailGP demonstrate how a sports NFT community can achieve much more for fans than simply distributing a digital collectible. The next generation of sports NFTs will not just be JPEGs; they will also reward fans for their support and have some form of experience-based utility. ""When you start looking at the history of physical collectibles, most of them start off as a utility-based product,"" explains Kulkarni.""Wristwatches, for instance, were originally intended to tell the time. And now they're one of the hottest categories of collectibles. I think we're going to see a new evolution of NFTs, where you can do something with them, and many will be redeemed for something that is useful or enjoyable."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1972px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1972px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63c9688ed7c8c94243436cb5_IW2_9483.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > SailGP's Bermuda and Caribbean team has recently become the first fan-owned team in professional yachting. </figcaption></figure>""The lowest hanging fruit is ticket stubs,"" Kulkarni continues.""Old ticket stubs are valuable in a large part because, back in the day, people simply threw them away. But that same supply dynamic no longer exists. Therein lies the opportunity: how can someone create digital ticket stubs with both collectible value and utility?""  Kulkarni speculates that event ticket stubs, in sports and beyond, could evolve to become even more engaging and even more useful. For example, fans who are verified to have attended a game could redeem their digital stub for something valuable fans. Speaking to <a href=""https://fortyeightminutes.com/exclusive-mark-cuban-talks-mavericks-more/"" > Forty-Eight Minutes </a>, Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, gives an idea of how teams are experimenting with applying this concept in practice.""Let's say that Luka Doncic has a 30 assist game. There are going to be 500,000 people who say that they were there, but only those who were actually there get the NFT commemorating that game.""  Ultimately, Cuban adds, the whole idea is to find new ways to engage match-going fans.""What gets you the NFT is that you actually scan your ticket. And if you go to ten games, well, there will be rewards for that.""   ""I think we're going to see a new evolution of NFTs.""    Vasu Kulkarni, Managing Partner, Courtside Ventures   This turns digital collectibles into assets that are actually useful to fans.""One of the companies we've invested in is securing rights from leagues to get game-worn jerseys right after games are played,"" Kulkarni explains.""They vault that jersey in a secure location and mint an NFT connected with it."" Those sorts of items are valuable collectibles themselves, and represent the tangible utility that make web3 sports communities exciting for their fans. ""Fans deserve to be rewarded, whether that's through ownership, experiences, or even monetary gain,"" says Kulkarni.""That's what I'm most excited about, and it is where the intersection of sports fandom and web3 is heading.""  Redefining fan communities and ownership   With opportunities appealing enough to persuade fans to buy into a community, and some who do so potentially with a view to selling their membership NFT for a profit, web3 communities run the risk of their being interpreted as securities, thus bringing legal quagmire with them. Noting that""NFTs can represent a wide array of assets (beyond) financial services,"" the <a href=""https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1133404/TR_Privacy_edits_Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_vP.pdf"">UK Government</a> is just the latest of government around the world to recognise that, writ large, NFTs are not securities, though <a href=""https://big3.com/news/decentralized-autonomous-organization-krause-house-to-purchase-fire-tier-ownership-nft-allotment-for-ball-hogs-big3-team/"" >Krause House</a> and <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/degods-dao-buys-big3-league-034614159.html"" >DeGods</a>, both of which have purchased valuable assets in their ownership stakes of minor league basketball teams, demonstrate that financial services can be amongst the opportunities offered via a membership token.  That concern was critical to SailGP as they sought to replicate that approach in basketball, but for a sailing team.""The first step was figuring out how we were going to do this in a regulatory compliant way,"" Reynolds explains.""An ownership stake in a professional sports team is a security, plain and simple."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2117px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2117px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63c96a22b57c8271a446c1f7_KC2_0885.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > SailGP's Class B token gives holders access to exclusive benefits, including in-person experiences. </figcaption></figure> Their solution is an ownership structure involving two classes of tokens, one for a main DAO, and another for a sub-DAO, both of which are built on the NEAR blockchain. Holders of the Class A tokens must be accredited investors in the United States, and it is this DAO that has the ownership stake, but other fans can purchase Class B tokens, which function more like a high value season ticket for holders, leveraging the data interoperability that exists in blockchain ecosystems. ""We wanted to create opportunities for fan engagement for those who aren't accredited investors,"" says Reynolds.""Our Class B token is not an equity stake in the team, it is more of a membership that comes with voting and governance rights, along with exclusive benefits that range from digital to in-person with the team.""  GarageXYZ demonstrates the tangible ways in which these benefits can be appealing. They are advised by Scott Dixon, one of the most successful motorsport drivers of all time, who the community sponsored in the Indy 500 race last May. Ten community members had exclusive access to the garages, pits, and grid on race day, and attended a private party post-race with the drivers. It is a glimpse into the future of how sports and web3 can combine to feed passion and reward a team's most engaged fans.   ""They want to know how their league can create a community as we have.""    Peter Miller, GarageXYZ   The next leap for Miller and the Ethereum-based community is propelling undiscovered drivers to new heights. GarageXYZ is currently funding and supporting two drivers, Rasmus Lindh, of the Indy NXT circuit, and Julia Landauer, who is attempting to break into the NASCAR Xfinity series. ""We saw Julia and Rasmus as two drivers with huge potential, and for whatever reason, their funding had dried up,"" Miller explains.""We came together as a community and the holders voted to use funds and resources to support them. For instance, the community is helping Rasmus with suit design, travel coordination, and social media management.""  Across the world, sports fans have felt as though they were on the outside looking in, despite their passion and endless dedication to their favourite team or athlete. Projects, founders, and web3 innovators are planning to challenge that dynamic. GarageXYZ members can actively propel an athlete into the spotlight; those in the SailGP DAO can impact their team's performance; and NFTs hold promise to tangibly reward those fans who attend every single game, with valuable collectibles and experiences. ""The head of web3 from one of the world's largest racing leagues actually minted one of our NFTs,"" Miller says, smiling.""They want to know how their league can create a community as we have, where you can be involved at a compelling level with pro motorsports.""

Crypto capital: how DAOs are bringing investing onchain,investment daos,Mon Dec 05 2022 17:09:04,DAOs make it easy for people to pool funds over the internet. Investment DAOs are one of the most obvious and impactful uses of that unique feature of web3. Jason Levin explores how the sector is taking shape and the key actors to watch.,Sun Dec 04 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Communities-built,Investors; Daos; Nft,Jason," Investment clubs have existed long before web3, but blockchain can change these established practices. In crypto, we have investment DAOs: a decentralised group of individuals who come together to invest in onchain assets like NFTs or other assets like traditional stocks. With theses ranging from fashion NFTs to venture-style software-as-a-service firms, investment DAOs allow investors to act on collective investment decisions, providing a way for small investors to access the same types of investment opportunities that were previously only available to large institutions or wealthy individuals. ""Welcome to the DAO side""  Syndicate is the tool that everyone who spends time in with investment DAOs should know. A DAO tooling startup for investment syndicates, it provides the fundamental governance infrastructure that is revolutionising the processes through which asset managers raise, manage, and deploy investment capital.""Welcome to the DAO side,"" <a href=""https://twitter.com/theDAOside/status/1386028292990390273?s=20&t=NsIc6DmnpNgt9tKa_ps-GA"" >reads</a> Syndicate's community Twitter page  they claim that 10,000 clubs are built on their infrastructure, <a href=""https://twitter.com/SyndicateDAO/status/1493248919211438082"">10% of all DAOs</a> (a figure which lacks independent verification).  The company, which recently raised $6m from investors including Andreesen Horowitz and Coinbase Ventures, provides tools that let users quickly spin up new DAOs to serve as onchain investment clubs. In just a few clicks, a group of friends or an established organisation can create an onchain club, optionally form a legal entity around it, and smoothly collect the required funds. Syndicate's toolbox is integrated with common web3 tools like Snapshot for voting and Gnosis. The customisable legal documentation was built in collaboration with Latham &amp; Watkins, the law firm, and Doola, a law-tech startup that makes it easy for DAOs to set up as a legal entity. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:500px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""500px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/638e2329b1057d67de17be3c_synd.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Syndicate's web3 investment clubs run on Ethereum and are powered by ERC-20 infrastructure. </figcaption></figure> As well as investing in onchain assets, accredited US investors can invest in offchain assets like startups or public companies.

""Welcome to the DAO side""    Syndicate   Syndicate, however, is just the infrastructure. Whilst it provides the foundations for many of web3's most interesting DAOs, tooling is only as much as its impact. And when it comes to impact, MetaCartel Ventures and Red DAO are two of the most important investment DAOs in web3.  MetaCartel Ventures  If the punk-rock kid from high school was a DAO, it'd be MetaCartel Ventures. But punk-rock is all grown up. A syndicate of 61 investors, including Stani Kulechov and Roneil Romberg, CEOs of Aave and Audius, respectively, MetaCartel Ventures stems from a drive to foster ecosystem-wide coordination.  MetaCartel takes a three-pronged approach in which participants can get funding, give funding as a member, or contribute to work in the DAO itself, which invests sums between $20,000 to $100,000 in web3 projects built on Ethereum. They've invested in DAOHaus, a no-code tool for building DAOs; The Defiant, a DeFi news outlet; the savings protocol and game PoolTogether; and Rarible, the NFT marketplace. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/638e16842af3baea5b10a608_YHW0uusIvAtijBGAt_qqqon2hGskn-agQEeDBsXDsSiapRmWsAjPuxO85yyZxw1M6PLUami_wsPTDPndchxniOhmOmyeYHxJNbqWCJSKcF29YRTtHZp8aGT1qg3ByNimegCiLW5fwV8UCDDJeK3sKY3Bnskr03rxM_8aGsx-1oBlf-VVjpM2fTuhUsXzgw.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > For MetaCartel, simplicity is a virtue.

Whilst entry into the DAO is member-curated, anyone can work for the DAO and meet existing members; it is not a closed ecosystem.  MetaCartel funds projects with investments as well as grants, but argues that its network of community support is just as valuable as the capital  providing founders with advice, connections, and social capital from some of web3's leading operators and thought leaders. As they write across their website and social media presence:""if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.""  Red DAO  Meanwhile, Red DAO is web3's answer to anyone who says crypto-natives have bad fashion taste.

Alongside these investments, the collection has grown to""hundreds of NFTs"", according to Greta, and includes Gucci Grails, fashion photography, and avatars from RTFKT, the digital sneakers studio that was acquired by Nike in 2021.  They're not just investing in NFTs though. The DAO has written checks to The Fabricant, CYBR, Artisan, and others. And like MetaCartel, their capital is as much entry to a broader ecosystem as it is the main product.

" ""We're building a world""  Jadyn Violet on web3 music culture",jadyn violet on music culture in web3,Mon Jan 30 2023 16:53:43,"Jadyn Violet has entered the music industry during a time of foundational change, part of a new generation eager to forge a new path beyond the traditional record label. He speaks to Clovis McEvoy about organising IRL events, finding a healthier social discourse, and why community trumps a bear market.
",Mon Jan 30 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Music,Hip-Hop; Indie; Alternative; Rap; North-America,Clovis McEvoy," Jadyn Violet will be the first to admit that he has not been making music all that long ""three to four years"" is the figure that he volunteers. However, over that short timespan, the self-taught singer, songwriter, and producer has created an exciting and dynamic body of work, building an active community of supporters along the way.   Born and raised in New Jersey, Jadyn originally began to explore music production after becoming dissatisfied with school.""I was very good in school, I was applying myself, but I realised that it wasn't bringing me any actual joy. That's when I started putting together these weird, one-minute beats.""  Music might have remained just a hobby for Jadyn, was it not for an encounter with that most universal of human experiences.""I got my heart broken,"" he says frankly,""That's when I fell in love with music. The experience of having those heavy feelings in my chest, and the realisation that making music could lift that energy out and direct it into something new, something I could share with the world  that just blew my mind. I've been making music every day since then."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63d7fb5b1cca1c28254947f0_Screenshot%202023-01-30%20at%2017.15.52.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Jadyn's love for music stemmed from heartbreak:""The experience of having those heavy feelings in my chest, and the realisation that making music could lift that energy out and direct it into something new just blew my mind."" </figcaption></figure> Drawing influence initially from Michael Jackson, Justin Bieber, and Travis Scott, Jadyn's music has steadily evolved from the trap-heavy beats of his 2019 debut single, Choppa Beams, to the detailed pop production and introspective lyrics of his more recent work. Of course, writing songs is one thing, but getting them heard by a receptive audience is another. Jadyn says that finding a community was one of the key sticking points he grappled with early on in his career.""It was very hard for me to find that communal aspect of music,"" Jadyn recalls.""I've lived in central New Jersey my entire life and every time I wanted to meet other musicians I had to drive two hours up to New York.""  Initially, social media seemed to be the obvious solution to the challenge of building a community remotely, but Jadyn says that he quickly grew disillusioned with the culture that he found on Instagram and TikTok.""The essence of my web2 relationships were very surface level,"" he explains.""I was gaining a community, getting these videos that blew up, but it was never sustained for more than a month. I wanted a community that was willing to have a deeper connection than just a fire emoji or a repost, a community that was going to stay by me, not only for my music, but for me as a person.""  In web3, Jadyn found what he was looking for: a supportive community built on positivity, in his words.""People in web3 are just nice, you know?"" he explains.""All my web2 interactions were egotistical and narcissistic. It's very interesting that being kind never got me far in web2, but in web3 it's actually one of the main things pushing me forward."" In April 2022 Jadyn launched his<a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/violet-token"" > Violet Token</a>, which serves as an admission pass to his core community, and, since then, he has never looked back.

These days, his spaces start at the more reasonable hour of 11am EST, with hundreds of attendees arriving daily to discuss not only web3 music and NFTs, but""literally anything"". Today, UVR is an open forum that has been instrumental in building a strong community around the artist's music, culminating in a series of IRL music events in 2022.   ""Being kind never got me far in web2, but in web3 it's one of the main things pushing me forward.""     Jadyn Violet  ""We ended up hosting the first ever UVR in Brooklyn, during NFT-NYC 2022,"" he says.""We had over 250 people come in from South America, Canada, California, Europe. The same people that were showing up in those Twitter Spaces ended up showing up in real life."" Jadyn has since gone on to host UVR events in Virginia, in Cincinnati, and most recently at Art Basel, Miami. Drawing members of Jadyn's web3 community together, each event focuses on promoting local artists, onboarding new people to the web3 music scene, and, of course, having fun.""These events were a real light bulb moment,"" he says.""We're not only building a community, but we are also building an ecosystem, we're building a world  it has a whole vibe to it.""  In the near term, Jadyn says that his focus has shifted to writing a larger NFT collection. Reticent to share the details, Jadyn says that his goal is to use gamified mechanics to provide listeners with something different and special.""I'm purposely not dropping anything at the moment and won't be for the next two or three months,"" he says.""I'm building up for a major project. I don't want to drop music NFTs just for the sake of it, I want to provide real value and make sure that the people who choose to buy something from me get their money's worth.""  It is a remarkably principled outlook, especially given the financial headwinds that have battered the wider crypto markets.""All of that is just noise to me,"" Jadyn says.""Bear market, bull market, whatever. I'm over here building my community and, if you have a community, it will sustain you."" ",1880

Best known to the world through his alter-ego Jagwar Twin, the artist's work pulses with a cerebral intensity and a complete commitment to concept. Over the past two years the 33-year-old singer-songwriter has released a series of boundary pushing multimedia projects and sharply observed alt-pop tracks, turning himself into one of the most intriguing artists building in web3.  Born and raised in Orange County, California, Roy describes himself as an""intense"" child, driven to create but always struggling with a sense of dislocation.""I had so many thoughts and feelings as a young kid,"" he says.""I often didn't know how to express myself in language.""  Drawn intuitively to the folk and Celtic music his mother would play around the house, Roy says it wasn't until he happened across a live music venue named Chain Reaction, at the age of 13, that he found the kindred spirits he'd been looking for. Populated by a small community who would gather to hear local punk bands play, Roy recalls the power of that music and the feeling of clarity it gave him about his own creative path. ""I knew I was going to make music forever,"" Roy says.""There was never a backup plan. I felt like I was going to make music or die trying.""  Roy lost no time cutting his teeth in the music industry. Touring his way through his late teens and early twenties, Roy developed his skills as a performer, vocalist, and songwriter  "" racking up producer and song-writing credits for artists like Lana Del Rey and <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/2ToIksTPpJ4csKPEOdUEyM?si=a0d56372e9164c61"">Alesso</a>.   ""I was going to make music or die trying.""    Roy English   By the time Roy was ready to take on the mantle of his stage name Jagwar Twin and release an album of his own, <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/30wS5swfGB4JMnXg4pnKXM?si=1hxjgYD2QpuUprsYSCxt2Q""> Subject To Flooding </a>, he was a seasoned musician with something to say. However, that was 2018: in what is now becoming a familiar tale, the sudden arrival of Covid-19 a couple of years later brought the music industry to a standstill, and left Roy to take stock of his career and his goals. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63528ebc422d687a130cbd37_Copy%20of%20Copy%20of%20220810-JagwarTwin-33-Promo-18.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Performing since his teenage years, Roy English has racked up credits with the likes of Lana Del Rey and Alesso. </figcaption></figure>""I really used that time to re-evaluate why I was making music in the first place,"" he says.""Some of that childhood intensity was manifesting in the kind of music I was making. There was a part of me that was making music out of a need to survive and a deep desire for external validation.""  Roy began dedicating hours each day to meditation and to reading, analysing himself and the wider world he inhabited. Acutely aware of the isolation, anxiety, and depression that so many people experienced during the months of pandemic lockdown, Roy created a free weekly space where he could give guided meditation sessions to fans who needed support.""We had over 1,000 weekly registered users and so many transformational experiences,"" he recalls.  Roy credits those meditation sessions with fans as a key influence that ultimately led to his breakout track, Happy Face. Released in December 2020, the single has since racked up over 100 million plays across streaming platforms. But it was the accompanying <a href=""https://cthdrl.co/jagwartwin-happyface"">interactive experience</a> that really encapsulated the new direction Roy was taking with Jagwar Twin. Using facial recognition software, the Happy Face app required fans to hold a smile  "" for the entire length of the song  "" in order to keep listening.  All the while, the video displays a collection of images, some odd, some dystopic.""I wanted to experiment with how a fan could really immerse themselves psychologically and physiologically in a song,"" Roy explains. The dichotomy of smiling amidst Roy's satirically peremptory calls to consume, whilst Hollywood [is] telling you what to wear and what to like and how to be',""creates a very interesting effect on the mind,"" he says.""It really gets to the heart of the question the song asks."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63529032b93012473dbab6c8_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(5).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Fans who held their smile were treated to hearing the song before it was available elsewhere, but if they lost their smile the song would come to a screeching halt. </figcaption></figure> Roy says his experience working on the experience with his frequent collaborators, the design studio <a href=""https://cthdrl.co/"">CTHDRL</a>, opened his mind to the potential that new technology has to craft powerful, immersive narratives.""I desire to tell stories,"" he explains.""The mediums change through the ages, but the stories are the same. It all felt naturally aligned.""  By 2022, Roy was busy working on his sophomore album, and growing increasingly frustrated with the pressure he felt to engage with social media.""I joked with the CTHDRL team saying, what if I uploaded my consciousness to the internet so that there could be a 24/7 social influencer version of me.'"" That offhand comment would ultimately provide the inspiration for Roy's next project: <a href=""https://twitter.com/JagwarTwin/status/1564792334696337408"">SARAVI</a>, the digital doppelganger of Jagwar Twin, and Roy's answer to the demands of influencer culture.  Trained over a series of months on Roy's responses, SARAVI  "" a creative take on an AI chatbot'  "" was given control of the official Jagwar Twin twitter account in August, forming part of the digital campaign that lead up to the release of his new album. While Roy has commented that SARAVI had the practical benefit of giving him mental space to focus on writing music, he also says the project intended to raise larger questions about social media and digital spaces:""Hopefully, as SARAVI grows, she can make more fans think about what a self' looks like in this digital age.""   ""The mediums change through the ages, but the stories are the same.""    Roy English   In parallel to these experimental projects, Roy was also becoming increasingly intrigued with web3 thanks to his involvement in <a href=""https://www.fwb.help/"">Friends With Benefits</a>  "" the loose collective of creatives, builders, and dreamers.""At first I was a little sceptical, as it felt naively utopian,"" Roy says of his first impressions.""But the idea of decentralisation and onchain records felt like it opened the door for rich storytelling in ways that could bring fans much deeper into the lore of the music  "" and allow fans to participate in a community where they could win financially by doing what they would do anyway.""  His curiosity rapidly snowballed, culminating in his most ambitious artistic project to date  "" the <a href=""https://jagwartwin.com/hall-of-mirrors""> Hall of Mirrors </a>. Conceived as an interactive, web3-powered, audio-visual experience, it is, in practice, a prism of Roy's memories, creations, thoughts, and stories.  Fans first enter the space by connecting their wallet and receiving a unique crown' NFT as an identifier. From that point on, they are left to traverse an ever-deepening rabbit hole populated by vivid shades of red, limited edition NFTs, grainy VHS footage, unreleased demos, and wireframe, 3D scans of objects and bodies.  As fans explore, they solve puzzles to unlock rooms' containing mintable 1/1 NFT artefacts. Fans who unlock a room are listed permanently onchain as the first person to access the space  "" but simultaneously each room that is discovered is a gift to the community as a whole; once a door is opened it becomes accessible to all other fans, growing and expanding the experience. As they delve deeper and acquire artefacts, fans can keep what they find as a collectible NFT to gain future utility, such as first access to future drops, or they can sell what they find on secondary marketplaces.  This unique combination of immersive interactivity, NFTs, music, and visual arts, is the perfect companion and primer to Jagwar Twin's new album, <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/1FDNmr1WNyQ0Ag27IBAc06?si=pD8YoCCIReqrUrv5NPK9iw""> 33 </a>. A simultaneous critique and celebration of our current internet age, it blends an eclectic mix of pop, electronica, disco, alternative rock, and more. Building upon its predecessor, the new album features Roy's most ambitious song writing to date; pushing the musical envelope and delving deep into the defining issues of a generation. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/635290bd3684d04179729447_Copy%20of%20220810-JagwarTwin-33-Promo-RedFinal.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption><em>Roy's new album, 33, features his most ambitious song-writing to date, pushing the musical envelope and delving deep into the defining issues of a generation. </figcaption></figure>""We are more connected to each other than ever, but somehow many of us feel more disconnected from ourselves,"" says Roy.""We are the stories we tell, and I wonder if we have forgotten who we are. On  33  I am asking: what will our human story be?""  The storyteller in Roy can be seen on full display in his recent <a href=""https://www.sound.xyz/jagwartwin/the-song-of-the-sun-and-the-moon-33-demo"">genesis drop on Sound</a>. Selling out in under a minute, the previously unreleased track,  The Song of The Sun &amp; The Moon , is lyrically tender, loaded with poignant imagery, and comes with an accompanying window into Roy's writing process. Describing a period of solitude, in the woods of Ithaca, New York, the artist gives fans an unfiltered description of his emotional state as the song was made:""I had just been dropped from a major record label and had been largely unsuccessful in terms of making a living as an artist, but I felt a peace about it all in that moment. I was proud of myself.""   ""Disconnecting allows you to get perspective on what is really going on.""  Looking at a song like this, and at projects like  Hall of Mirrors  and SARAVI, it's hard not to see a warring desire within him to&nbsp;connect with fans and share intimacy, but also to stay one step removed. Where some might see paradox, Roy sees a natural duality which he embraced long ago. ""To be able to share deeply personal stories and memories and connect with others, you need to be able to connect with yourself,"" he says.""The only way I know to do that is to disconnect and be with myself. Disconnecting allows you to zoom out and get perspective on what is really going on.  That said, Roy makes clear how pivotal his fans and community are to him.""Always being available as an artist and a human can have negative impacts,"" says Roy.""But conversely, we have the opportunity to connect with each other and form beautiful relationships. I am so grateful to know some of the Jagwar Twin fans and collectors in the web3 space. They are amazing geniuses and make it so much fun to build in this space.""  Talking with Roy, it's clear that there is another goal that seems to sustain all others  "" yes, to""redefine what being an artist can look like,"" but also more broadly: to tell a story, and, through the telling, reflect back to us our actions and consequences.""Every civilisation has its myths and tales,"" says Roy.""Those stories shape the way humans of that age live their lives and orient themselves in the world. What are the stories we tell in the current digital age?""  The work of Jagwar Twin is an open question, posed to our modern conceptions of society and self, of mass media and consumption, and of the stories that shape culture. For some, the answer to these questions is unsettling, but Roy holds to an optimistic view.""Whatever technologies we create will be created in our own image. It is up to us how we will use it  "" but I do have faith in humanity to use it, unselfishly, to build a better world. I meet people almost every day who make me believe that it is possible."" ",3646
Let colour transport you in time  in conversation with Jan Baumgartner,jan baumgartner,Mon Jul 25 2022 13:28:13,"Jan Baumgartner, known for bringing a passion for colour to his minimalist art style, sits down with Steph Kunkel Kunkel to explore the opportunity he's been given by web3, why he deplores black and white minimalism, and how his pieces help the viewer travel back in time.",Mon Jul 25 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Tezos; Ethereum; Minimalism,Steph Kunkel," Jan Baumgartner describes his art as""Minimal. Vivid. Bold. A decelerator from the everyday noise."" His unique minimalist style seeks to bring attention to the genre and minimalist form, illustrating how transforming and compelling this style can be and the emotions it can evoke. By letting his emotions and relationships with colour drive the intention for his pieces, he creates artwork that uncovers the norms of focal points in art  letting colour be the heart and focal point of his work, with the people merely accents. His reflective and introspective point of view allows him to draw inspiration from everywhere, creating captivating pieces that we can all relate to.  Jan's artistic journey began while he was training as a wood turner, later evolving as he studied architecture, and he began sharing his own digital work on Instagram in 2015. During the pandemic, Jan saw a drop in his Instagram engagement, and with encouragement from his friends in the art community, transitioned into the web3 space and started spending more time on NFT Twitter.  Traditionally, minimalism can be considered cold and flat, but Jan's pops of colours enhance and revitalise the genre. One of the drawbacks of mainstream black and white minimalism is that although the compositions are beautiful, lack of colour  "" which Jan puts down to artistic fear  "" can make it difficult to discern one artist from another; the pieces tend to bleed together and get washed out. Jan uses colour to express his feelings and his artwork to explore and show people the beautiful power of colour.   ""Before joining the web3 community, I did what people wanted me to. Now, I do the art I want to do.""    Jan Baumgartner   Nonetheless, Jan's creative process begins by sketching geometries in black and white. Once the geometry has strength and really hits him, he then rebuilds it in PhotoShop, only now adding colour, and then later, a person, always a single person. The colour selection process for Jan's work is extensive, and he typically tries a minimum of 15ì35 colour arrangements before selecting the desired colour for each piece.  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" style=""max-width:40%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright"" data-rt-max-width=""40%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62de95f93d3e1fa265f015f1_Be%20aware%20of%20wonder.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/82282176112798931255639462238037557192944349392222763613772345361039360000001""> Be aware of wonder </a> , by Jan Baumgartner, on OpenSea. Jan uses orange to amaze and inspire awe, whilst blue emotes calm and relaxation. </figcaption></figure> The last step is the most physical part of the process: it requires Jan to go out and photograph people.  He looks for people waiting for the train or bus, people after work, people waiting to cross the street, and expressionless people. He waits for the right person to photograph to capture that intense moment of someone waiting and not moving. This brings stillness and stability to the pieces and tethers a figure to his artwork. There's almost a silence in this stillness, a period of waiting and simply being. A moment of human expression and exhalation.  Jan, who creates art on Ethereum and Tezos, uses people in his images partly for scaling purposes, to show how large the space is and how a person interacts with the space and colour. By selecting people with blank and emotionless faces, he allows the colour to act as the emotional framework for his pieces; the human figures mere backdrops. This clever tactic invites viewers to insert themselves into the piece and explore their personal relationship with colours, letting the mind wander and explore the memories they associate with that hue. In his intention, this process allows us to transport ourselves into the piece and develop a deeper exploration of our emotions as they relate to colour.   Often, we think of humans as the subjects or focal points of pieces. Jan's work disrupts this pattern by letting colour dictate the emotions that it evokes. At the same time, Jan embraces the idea of anonymity through his faceless figures, drawing less attention to the people in his artwork and allowing the colours to take the stage. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1254px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1254px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62f5867f0f591772bd0cdeba_Think%20yellow.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://foundation.app/@jnbmgrtnr/relativemedium/5""> Think yellow </a> , by Jan Baumgartner. Jan uses the colour yellow to evoke feelings of joy and positivity. </figcaption></figure> Jan uses his own memories and emotions to foster his relationships with colours by assigning them personas that give character to the colours in his pieces. He wants viewers to draw a deep emotion behind his visuals; the beauty of Jan's work is that he knows each person has their own relationship with each colour.  Jan's artwork makes the composition as focused and minimal as possible to allow viewers to build their own relationship with the piece.""Perception is always based on your point of view. If you see yellow, what I see, might be totally different."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" style=""max-width:50%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright"" data-rt-max-width=""50%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62de9972b97e5f0fa840e715_Precise%20007.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/653993""> Precise 007 </a> , by Jan Baumgartner, on Objkt. He uses green to communicate themes of revitalisation and refreshment. </figcaption></figure> Each person will interact with every colour differently, which will evoke and awaken memories from their past, allowing viewers to transport themselves back in time to their own experiences through Jan's artwork.""At a time when heightened sensitivity is such an obvious need in all areas in which humans are involved,"" he says,""an awareness of colour can provide a major weapon against the forces of callousness and brutalisation.""  I like to think of Jan's creative work as a type of artistic time travel, allowing viewers to use colour and composition to evoke and awaken forgotten memories, and take us back to a time when our emotions were raw and true. This allows us to transcend time and space, step out of ourselves and remember a fragment, a moment, that we can capture, distil, and elongate to savour those precious moments of our lives.  Jan's new collection is a vacation series,  Fragmented Memories , composed of pieces he reimagines from his memories. As opposed to his typical web3 artwork, this series does not include any people, giving Jan the space to explore his own relationship with colour more deeply, while adding more depth to the scenery. This is a chance for him to explore another way of telling others about his passion for art.  Jan reflects on how the world seems to be moving in opposite directions, almost departing from one another. His perception of colour, minimalism, and community allows him to explore and create pieces that encourage people to evoke their curiosity and self-reflect  slowly moving humanity closer together, one colour at a time.

How Jburn is building a hip hop career from the ground up,jburn,Mon Jun 20 2022 15:58:17," ""I don't have designs or big plans for these things I'm making, I just build them brick by brick""  Jburn shows how artists are taking careers into their own hands with web3.

I thought they were lying."" So says Jburn, the independent rapper-producer whose bite-sized beats and vibey GIFs make for some of the most striking web3-native music around.""Of course, they genuinely liked the music and wanted to say something nice, but really taking what they were saying to heart? That was a learning curve for me.""   Needing time to adjust is understandable: web3 moves at a breakneck pace, but Jburn's journey to defining the new ""music NFT standard"" was not pre-ordained. Today, Jburn enjoys the support of an active community and thousands of fans, but rewind even a few years back and he was struggling to find his footing in the old-school music industry. ""I was living in my dad's basement,"" he recalls.""I had a little cracked version of Fruity Loops, and I was just chasing the music, learning, making amateur stuff."" Jburn spent five years as part of underground hip-hop group, The Free Souls, before kicking off his solo career in 2020. He remembers those early years as a great learning experience, but also the sense of frustration that came with trying to gain followers and find collaborators.  ""Most of the things I'm doing right now in web3 are things I wanted to do in web2 - but it was just so much harder there,"" he says.""Now, there's so much incentive for early listeners, and for collab's. Here I've met more motivated people, with more heart, and more determination. It's been fantastic.""   ""Only so many people can get this collab or this song, and I love it.""    Jburn, on what makes music NFTs special   The jump off point for web3 came to Jburn from a seemingly left-field source: basketball cards. A long-time collector and trader, he first took notice of the crypto world when the NBA started releasing their Top Shot NFTs. Around the same timeframe Dogecoin was breaking through into the popular consciousness, Bitcoin was rising ever higher, and Jburn began thinking about how his songs could translate to the world of NFTs. ""I'd always been collecting basketball cards, buying and selling,"" says Jburn.""It was about bringing that same desire into the digital, gamifying things and making my music collectible, like really collectible. Only so many people can get this collab or this song, and I love it. I think it's so cool. It makes the collecting experience unique and fun.""  After some initial shopping around, the artist settled on Tezos and the Objkt marketplace as the space to release his work.""Tezos immediately felt like home,"" he says.""It just had everything that I wanted, all just readily available and accessible. I haven't looked back since then.""   ""I felt like this is the new music NFT standard.""    Jburn, on synthesising music, GIFs, and NFTs   Part of what has made Jburn's work so successful on the platform is his distinctive blend of moving images and hip-hop vignettes. Many of his songs come in under the two-minute mark, their lo-fi production, and introspective lyrics infinitely replay-able. It's a format the integrates perfectly with GIFs, the tiny, looping videos that have become ubiquitous in internet memes.  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-floatright"" style=""padding-bottom:60%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""floatright"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""60%"" data-rt-dimensions=""500:500"" data-page-url=""https://soundcloud.com/jburnpgh/abundance""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fw.soundcloud.com%2Fplayer%2F%3Fvisual%3Dtrue%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fapi.soundcloud.com%252Ftracks%252F1153729258%26show_artwork%3Dtrue&display_name=SoundCloud&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fjburnpgh%2Fabundance&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi1.sndcdn.com%2Fartworks-8SGz44cRlv5xyQnf-jAwtFQ-t500x500.jpg&key=96f1f04c5f4143bcb0f2e68c87d65feb&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=soundcloud"" title=""""></iframe> </figure> Working with some of his favourite digital artists, Jburn pairs each release with bespoke animation that not only catch the eye but adds new layers of meaning to the song. ""I started out making GIFs on my own,"" he says.""I was really digging the vibe that they could provide  "" it's like sharing a story, it takes people deeper into the song. Pretty quickly I realised my own limitations as a visual artist, and so I wanted to do collaborations with other amazing artists that could complement my sound and give it more of a cohesive vision than a still image would.""  His first collaboration was with <a href=""https://twitter.com/artikudee"">Artikude</a> on the track <a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/506172"">Abundance</a>. With fluorescent cyberpunk style, and a TV-cat scrolling through cynical lyrics, the interplay between Artikude's visuals and Jburn's snappish beats felt undeniably fresh when first minted in November 2021. ""When Abundance dropped, I was so happy with the product,"" he says.""I felt like this is the new music NFT standard, for me at least."" Now, Jburn says GIFs have become his""bread and butter"" and he alternates between collaborations with visual artists and releases which feature his own art.  ""If Jburn says he's gonna do something crazy in a tweet  "" well, watch out because he'll actually do it.""    Jburn, on the story because The Micro Album   In February 2022 he released The Micro Album, a ten-track collection that cemented his place in the new world of independent web3 music; it's just 12 minutes and 20 seconds long.""The Micro Album originally came together because a lot of people were bothering me about like releasing cohesive projects,"" he says.""But I make one-minute songs and even if I did 20 tracks it's not gonna be a full album.

He's the first to acknowledge that doing everything yourself is not an easy path, and that there are some drawbacks.""It can be super hard. I write the songs, sometimes I produce them, I perform them, I promote them, I have to upload it all, and I need to reach out and stay connected with the fans and collectors.

However, when asked whether he'd sign all that control over for an easier ride, the answer is clear.""I like the independence.

How Jekein Lato-Unah is celebrating and empowering women with her art,jekein lato unah,Tue Aug 02 2022 14:28:58,"Jekein Lato-Unah blends figurative modernism and traditional mixed media techniques to create captivating digital artwork, depicting women in their truest forms. By embracing her culture and utilising bright colours that embody the vitality that flourishes in her soul, Jekein's artwork sends a message to embrace life and freedom, welcome self-care, and champion empowerment.",Mon Aug 01 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Digital-Art; Nigeria; Africa,Steph Kunkel," With a paintbrush as her weapon, Jekein is the epitome of a modern-day creative warrior. Her art captures black portraiture through oil paintings, and her purpose is to give voice to the voiceless. Strong-willed and passionate, the 25-year old radiates positive energy, which translates into her artwork, full of colourful and eye-catching images that ease the mind.   A former Programs lead and paralegal at female-focused non-profits, Jekein is in her final year studying law at the University of Lagos, where her research in human rights, gender law, and family law, has exposed her to numerous heartbreaking experiences. ""You want to take more into your own hands and help others. When you know the perpetrators and the people who are hurting, you see these stories in real-time; you want to help."" Jekein would go home and pour out on canvas, using her oil paintings to release her anger. She would experiment and play with colours and backgrounds to capture these women and their stories.   Inspired by these stories and her own experiences, Jekein illustrates the fight for women's equality through work that sheds light on real-life scenarios and captures what it is like to be marginalised, oppressed, and alienated. Specifically, she focuses on the objectification of women in Nigeria, where women typically do not seek help or report crimes against them for fear of being shamed and ostracised. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:4096px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""4096px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62e9379c2c30ae3146b026d0_tma.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/0xa9cf3fb2c4538ac95e0c822758ec745fcfed8360/the-morning-after-5""> The Morning After </a> , by Jekein Lato-Unah. Headlines from the JLU Artspaper: ""The Lagos Art Girls are THRIVING!""; ""NFTs are the new cool!""; and ""VIRGIL ABLOH Gone too soon¶"". </figcaption></figure> Jekein will never stop addressing social issues, fighting for the rights of others, and telling their stories. However, her new artwork takes a new angle  women embracing healing and self-love. She says her recent works""portray the lives of happy, free, successful black women, as opposed to the broken, unhappy, caged women now seeking freedom who I have depicted in the past.""  Recently, Jekein has shifted her artistic focus to women in their moments of ecstasy  pure enjoyment, light, happiness, and freedom.""I do not want to always tell the same story,"" she explains.""Every day I am growing and changing. I want to think about what is ahead and what is coming."" Jekein acknowledges that problems will always be present, but she is hopeful and optimistic about the future and what joy life will bring; her artwork reminds us to embrace happiness and live in the moment.   Jekein's new work, featured on SuperRare, consists of 3 new pieces: The Morning After', A Toast to Myself', and Bottomless Leisure'. The three self-portraits depict Jekein at different moments in time and signify periods in her life when she was grateful, celebrating her success, and taking time to relax. Begun in the middle of a locked-down 2020, Jekein uses these pieces as a reminder to make your own happiness, despite the circumstances.  Jekein's artwork seems to have a way of eloquently capturing a precise moment in time. The Morning After' is no different. This piece shows Jekein on a day where all seems right in the world, capturing a raw moment of celebration, satisfaction, joy, and relaxation. This work is the epitome of""chop life"" (to live life and enjoy yourself). She has even hidden some of her favourite things within the piece: her black mask, afro comb, and WHOT cards (which she always keeps in her purse).   This piece plays with time as Jekein sits, illustrated and brought to life in her own work at present, whilst reflecting on the past and how she got to this moment. We can see markers and remnants of the pandemic through the black mask and deduce the time based on the copy of the JLU Artspaper, a fictional magazine inspired by Jekein's initials and a product of her ambition to one day own her own publication. A draft copy of this JLU edition captures Jekein's colleagues and friends sharing their success in art and web3, as well as her own entrance into the space.

Jekein wants to help nurture a web3 ecosystem that can distinguish discrimination and promote equality among all artists fairly, with equal access to art, education, and the community.

"Between mind and machine  "" in conversation with Jenni Pasanen ",jenni pasanen,Wed Nov 30 2022 14:07:53," ""For me, art is healing."" Jenni Pasanen's artwork is a raw form of self-expression  "" a gateway to her mind and heart. Her NFTs comprise layers of AI shapes and digital brushstrokes, uniting the worlds of mind and machine. She speaks to Steph Kunkel Kunkel about process and purpose.",Mon Nov 28 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Ai-Art; Digital-Art; Finland; Europe,Steph Kunkel," Do we see art as it is or art as we are?   Objectively or subjectively? Jenni Pasanen believes that every person draws inspiration from this question.""When we create art, we are creating what we've been through in life,"" says the AI artist.""We create who we are on the canvas.""  Raised in Finland, Jenni has always been an artist, experimenting with various styles throughout her life from the physical  "" acrylic painting, clay, and sewing  "" to the digital, including animation and coding. She increasingly found that she could tie everything together with AI-augmented art, and when a friend introduced her to NFTs in early 2021, Jenni realised that web3 was the final missing link. ""Everything clicked into place,"" she recalls.""I finally felt like I had found my niche. I found who I am, and what I want to do; I found my home in art."" Jenni quit her job as an animator     and became a full-time artist. Exploring the human mind, anatomy, and science, she has quickly made a name for herself as one of web3's most distinctive and accomplished AI artist. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/638774354a661b17b745c47b_JPEG.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x184e50d7b8c7ab6f5ce78f2fb89ce57f384f1a10/60""> Today: 12:00 AM </a>  from Jenni Pasanen's   Time Eclipse   collection. </figcaption></figure> Having retained a keen interest in psychology and technology from childhood, it is no surprise that these topics are deeply embedded within her art. And blessed by 13 years spent as an animator, she combines AI (powered by general adversarial networks, or GANs) with digital art paintings to create compelling surrealism.""I love making art because you don't have to follow any rules  "" it's the freedom that I love about creating in web3.""  A lifelong creative, Jenni is familiar with the constraints common to digital creators in traditional art.""Before NFTs, selling digital art in its native form was really challenging and there wasn't, and still isn't, an easy way to do it."" Instead, digital artists rely on commissions, forced to tolerate the creative limitations that come with client work. ""Web3 and NFTs give artists the freedom to sell their art,"" she says, reiterating one of the most common reasons why artists have moved into web3, and one shared by other experienced design professionals, from <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/taya-ferdinand"">Taya Ferdinand</a> to <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/amrit"">Amrit Pal Singh</a>. Attracted by the ability to create freely and earn a living in a community where artists and collectors share a mutual relationship, Jenni shares that it was the community that attracted her to web3 as much as the technology.""I was drawn to web3 and the NFT community because of the amazing, supportive people, and I am very grateful for this.""  Jenni's art explores the relationship between man and machine.""You don't have to create something that is real,"" she explains.""Art is a way to create a visual representation of what is impossible  "" your art makes it possible."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/638776f5b09f12edcbdddc45_purple.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://makersplace.com/jennipasanen/mask-obscura-season-1-of-1-450898/""> Future </a>  from Jenni Pasanen's Mask Obscura   collection. </figcaption></figure>""I use Artbreeder's tiny, pixelated images because they are unfinished and don't resemble too much of anything,"" she shares, referring to the machine-learning art site that is a favourite amongst AI artists.""There are more advanced functions on Artbreeder, but this allows me to use my imagination more.""  At this point in the process, equipped with the smallest bit of inspiration, Jenni does not yet know how the piece will emerge. Nevertheless, she starts to tweak the base layer and build out her piece, merging digital painting and AI by layering her own digital strokes and the computer's on top of each other.   ""AI is not just a tool or extension of my craft  "" it's my muse.""    Jenni Pasanen   For Jenni, AI becomes a playground in which she can explore unlimited inspiration.""For me, AI is not just a tool or extension of my craft  "" it's my muse."" Jenni embraces the <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/ai-and-the-role-of-artists"">rise of AI in art</a>, rather than fearing it, won over by the belief that""human creativity will never stop evolving."" The natural response, therefore, is to evolve with it.  As opposed to the traditional art world where artists are known for their solo work, collaboration thrives in web3, where splitting royalties and sale income is a seamless process. For Jenni, working with the NFT collective Creative Work Studios, whose recent collaborative pieces have involved Refik Anadol and Kevin Abosch, helped her create some of her best work, namely her  Time Eclipse  collection.  The concept of time, Jenni reveals, has always fascinated her.""It is a rabbit hole of endless theories and possibilities."" She explains that"" Time Eclipse  is a land of limitless opportunities and dreams up a place where time is not bound."" The collection explores the significance of fragility, and is an attempt to preserve and engulf the fleeting passage of our lives. Its genius lies in simultaneously treating each moment as a distinct fragment of time, whilst showing how each is linked together. For Jenni, our lives consist of a series of long and intricate moments.  But her interpretation is just one amongst many. Whilst to Jenni, her art exhibits themes of time, life, and nature, she is cognizant that art can have as many interpretations as it can viewers. Ultimately, she uses AI to generate random shapes, and whilst distinctive, she compares the process to images from a Rorschach inkblot test.""Even if you show the Rorschach inkblot images to one million people, they all see it differently."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63877309b2c7b6c418198748_0f9eb2ebee103252ee85068c86d3cecb_762034.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://makersplace.com/jennipasanen/mask-obscura-season-1-of-1-450898/""> Season </a>  from Jenni Pasanen's Mask Obscura collection. </figcaption></figure> Indeed, though Jenni's artwork stems from her self-expression, one can also see themselves in it. In no collection is this more clear than  Mask Obscura . These beautiful, faceless creatures leave much to individual interpretation, and allow viewers to layer their own interpretations atop the brushstrokes and the GAN.   ""Human creativity will never stop evolving.""    Jenni Pasanen   Organised into four themes  "" seasons, elements, days, and time  "" and four acts, the collection is a series of beautiful beings, blending time and nature. The faceless, ethereal beings in  Mask Obscura      explore the relationship between humanity and nature, as opposed to Jenni's typical trope of the human mind versus AI. The collection evokes the beauty of life, juxtaposed with the complexities that arise from time, elements, and seasons: the markers of human society.  Mask Obscura , therefore, encompasses a push and pull in a thought-provoking assemblage.  Our life experiences, personalities, and emotions build our reality and mould our perception of art. Like the Rorschach inkblot test, one image produces as many interpretations as it has viewers. This begs the question:  Do we see art as it is or art as we are?  ",2311
" ""Awareness is the fundamental currency of our reality""  Jimmy Edgar on the power of provocative art",jimmy edgar,Tue Jan 10 2023 15:55:15,"Jimmy Edgar has always been a provocateur. With over twenty years at the forefront of experimental music, he doesn't think music NFTs are worth getting excited about. He speaks to Clovis McEvoy about his creative practice, why everything was really all about visual art, and how AI has allowed him to subvert his own aesthetics.

Jimmy Edgar is telling me about his new album and I am trying to keep up. This is a man who sold a <a href=""https://foundation.app/@JIMMY/oxy/15"">photo of a glass box</a> for $17,000, after all. The Detroit native has been pushing sonic boundaries in the experimental electronic music scene since 1999, bringing cerebral concepts and a punk aesthetic to dance floors around the world. His latest album,<a href=""https://jimmyedgar.bandcamp.com/album/liquids-heaven"" >  LIQUIDS HEAVEN </a> ,  is no exception.  Marking his 13th solo release, the album's bubbling synths and brooding beats are inspired by an examination of liquid.""Does liquid want to be contained?"" Jimmy ponders.""Does it want to flow? Does it want to be free? It's about considering this phase of matter as a sentient being."" It is this kind of idiosyncratic thinking that has made Jimmy such a unique creative voice, and not only within music. In recent years, his creative practice has begun to focus also upon visual art: digital, AI-assisted, and fully generative, as well as physical sculpture.  His most recent visual collection,<a href=""https://foundation.app/collection/plastics"" >  PLASTICS </a>, is an associative rumination on synthetic materials. Using deconstructed and retouched product photos, Jimmy designed a generative system that would present him with a selection of quasi-related objects. The resulting collage of imagery is part mood board, part rorschach test: the relationships perceived by the viewer says as much about the artists' intention as it does about our own unconscious associations and biases. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63bd97fb7fb15248801dfc3c_PLASTICS.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Jimmy Edgar's  <a href=""https://foundation.app/collection/plastics"" > PLASTICS </a>  collection, created using a generative system. </figcaption></figure>""I think stock photos are very challenging for people to understand as art,"" he says.""I'm very interested in conceptual art, provocative art, and the idea of appropriation. I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could make stock photos artistic.""  For those who have followed Jimmy's career closely, the artist's shift to visual mediums surely comes as no surprise. Even in early childhood he was already using art as a way to communicate, and to provoke.""I didn't really speak until I was about six years old,"" he says.""So drawing was my go-to form of expression, and the things that I drew were often challenging and shocking.""   Jimmy recounts a formative experience where, when asked to produce a drawing for a school art show, he created almost one hundred individual artworks. Rather than selecting only one piece, his art teacher decided to display the entire collection across the school.""She came to me and said, I wholeheartedly believe in you as an artist and in your potential',"" he recalls.""She gave me a little gift of some black ink. That really left a huge impression on me.""   ""Everything I have ever done, I consider to be visual.""     Jimmy Edgar   Had he been raised in a different environment, it is possible that Jimmy would have opted for a career in fine arts from the get-go. Growing up in turn-of-the-millennium Detroit, music was always going to take precedence, at least initially.""Music is very important to people there,"" Jimmy says. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1192px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1192px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63bd9a71693f11b65282fbf2_Screenshot%202023-01-10%20at%2017.03.13.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Jimmy Edgar considers himself as a primarily visual artist.""I call my music sculptures of air pressure', because that's what it feels like to me. I don't even really like to think of it as music."" </figcaption></figure> By fifteen he was playing underground raves, and signed to London-based Warp Records when he turned eighteen, joining a roster of ground-breaking electronic artists including Aphex Twin, Squarepusher, and Brian Eno. A long and successful music career followed, but through it all Jimmy maintains that his work has always come from a distinctly visual place.""Everything I have ever done, I consider to be visual,"" he says.""I call my music sculptures of air pressure', because that's what it feels like to me. I don't even really like to think of it as music.""  Fascinated by the concept of synaesthesia, Jimmy says that materials, colours, and shapes are the primary driving force behind his sound-based work.""My practice definitely feels holistic,"" he says.""But first and foremost, I'm a visual artist.""  Jimmy's exploration of visual mediums dovetailed perfectly with the rise of web3 and an exploding market for art NFTs.""I was making a lot of digital art, which I considered to be my best work and not something that I wanted to just release on social media. Meanwhile, I was hearing about blockchain technology from my good friend,<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/haydendunham/"" > Hayden Dunham</a>, who is an amazing artist. Then, at the end of 2020, Warp Records and all these other pioneering digital platforms began moving into web3. I didn't take much convincing and I was experimenting before long.""  ""Awareness is the fundamental currency of our reality.""    Jimmy Edgar   Those experiments have produced well over thirty NFT releases since his first drop,<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CMfd-lHB3Rz/"" >  DROOL OF VENUS </a>, in March 2021, and Jimmy has subsequently built an avid community of collectors united by an appreciation for his contrarian provocation. In no piece of his is that more emphatic than in OXYGEN, which he describes as a""physical structure that uses only air as the material, enclosed in glass."" <a href=""https://www.papermag.com/jimmy-edgar-oxygen-2657854758.html"">Exhibited last August</a> at Los Angeles' Vellum Gallery, the piece ultimately <a href=""https://foundation.app/@JIMMY/oxy/15"">sold for 13eth</a>, just over $25,000 at the time. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2400px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2400px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63bdb602fbba1228a0987c8d_Untitled.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Jimmy Edgar's OXYGEN, a physical sculpture with a certificate of authenticity listed on  <a href=""https://foundation.app/@JIMMY/oxy/15""> Foundation </a> . </figcaption></figure> However, whilst he sees plenty of exciting innovation in cryptoart, he is less enthusiastic about how musicians have been using the space to date.""I'm super critical because I've been embedded in the music industry for so long,"" he says, almost apologetically.""I feel like blockchain has been overlaid on music as an opportunistic kind of thing  it doesn't feel exciting.""  Asked if he sees a path forwards for web3 music, his reply is somewhat confounding:""There could be new kinds of creative economies; in-browser workstations to mint new music; onchain royalties; the ability to create generative music. Blockchain technology is so ripe for generative music, but at the moment, I have no interest.""  Talking to Jimmy, one is struck both by the boldness of his ideas and their fluidity. Perhaps his freewheeling discourse is another form of provocation: a method of communication he has honed since his early childhood drawings, and one that is now a core aspect of his art-making.""It's easy to stick out as an artist if you're brave and understand provocation,"" he says.""Awareness is the fundamental currency of our reality; wherever your awareness and attention go, that energy creates value. I'm very interested in provoking, and I think that art is an amazing vehicle for change.""  Simultaneously, Jimmy makes it clear that, in his view, attention must be intelligently directed. He draws an example from the recent<a href=""https://juststopoil.org/"" > Just Stop Oil</a> movement, which, in temporarily defacing high-profile artworks, became highly controversial.""The vandalising of work has been an utter failure,"" he says of the""stunts"".""I gather that they wanted to direct the conversation back to the environment, but I think that instead, the defaced artworks have gone up in value, and that the museums now have a new importance.""  Some might look at the confluence of societal and financial constraints that modern artists face and see a perilous tightrope. To stand out amongst an ever-expanding ocean of artistic content would seem a challenging prospect for many. But Jimmy sees our current digital age as one of democratised tools, near-limitless access to audiences, and astounding creative possibilities.""The present is the best time to be an artist,"" he says.""There's never been an easier time to learn a new skill, there's never been an easier time to showcase your work to the entire world. It's an opportunity to be your best.""  Given what he sees as the advantages of the modern world, he is not shy about calling out lacklustre uses of its opportunities.""There's so much bad, low-effort work out there,"" he laments,""and so many artists who do not understand the difference between being an artisan and being an artist. The artist is the person with the ideas, the person with the bravery to challenge people and show them a different perspective.

For instance, I'm working on a solo sculpture exhibition right now and I'm having all the pieces fabricated by an extremely skilled person who works with metal, epoxy, and acrylic. I would never want to do those things on my own, so it's really a great joy for me to collaborate with someone and have them create my ideas.  He's also become increasingly interested in how generative code and AI can be used to initiate those ideas or offer alternate perspectives.""Some of these projects were developed from a generative software I made, an idea generator called <a href=""https://twitter.com/JIMMYEDGAR/status/1585692651978117120?s=20&t=qRUbiDkeHgoYldfEJU1NWw"" > PROMPTZ </a>. It would give me the title of a work that fitted my aesthetic, it would give some objects, and say what the artwork was about. I would just keep refreshing this software and keep adding variables to it, and it would give me ideas for my work.""   ""The present is the best time to be an artist.""     Jimmy Edgar   The latest project to stem from his  PROMPTZ  software takes the form of a deconstructed medical supply room. Planned for release in 2023 through the<a href=""https://www.chainsaw.fun/about"" > Chain/saw</a> NFT marketplace, the collection is based upon hundreds of medical devices, instruments, and disposable items which Jimmy collected, photographed, and further developed through conversations with Chat GPT3, the AI text generator that has set the tech-world buzzing.  Jimmy asked the AI how he could bring more fun to the project. In reply, the algorithm suggested adding bright colours, gamifying the auction so that more people could interact with it, and adding a Bugs Bunny mascot, because the cartoon character is known for his catchphrase, what's up Doc?'. ""Some of its ideas are incredible. I'm so impressed with this technology,"" he says. From splicing together analogue tape reels as a teenager, to now using AI to generate, augment, or subvert his creative ideas, Jimmy is an artist who remains effortlessly cutting edge at every turn of his career.

Joanna translates this freedom into her art by being unapologetically true to herself. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1412px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1412px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62f6c598e7ae02c0029c46a6_birds%20born%20in%20a%20cage%20think%20flying%20is%20an%20illness.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >  "" <a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/402444""> Birds born in a cage think flying is an illness </a>  is based on my experience of being born in a cult.

Her success in web3 has provided the confidence and space to fully embrace that outlet in an untainted way, with themes of mental illness appearing across her work. By building a community directly around her and her art, NFTs have given Joanna an opportunity to create art that speaks deeply to both her and her audience. There is no particular colour palette to translate her feelings, but Joanna utilises double exposures to add contrast and depth to her photographs.  Joanna's creative process encompasses the randomness and mundanity of everyday life. She does not wait for anything exceptionally beautiful or sensational to happen to capture a photograph. She does not seek out a particularly scenic view or wait for the light to hit her focal point a certain way. Instead, Joanna captures the ordinary moments in our lives and uses this snapshot to transform her work into something ethereal.  Joanna plays with the concept of anonymity by not showing her full face in self-portraits, blocking off sections of an image and inducing feelings of prosopagnosia, a neurological disorder characterised by the inability to recognise faces. The viewer is only able to see fragments or portions of her face; these missing parts evoke a sense of curiosity and mystery behind her artwork. ""I have a habit of photographing everything that I find interesting, be it the smallest, most mediocre thing. Be it the sky, a tiny flower, or raindrops on a window."" Then that picture will sit in her gallery until she finds the inspiration to edit it, and the edit will sit again until Joanna takes a self-portrait. After that, she creates a double exposure with two images: the self-portrait and one of the many""mediocre things"" she's photographed.  She merges these two different photos together, each on their own days with their own circumstances and emotional connections, to create a new story and a new work of art.  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:746px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""746px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62f6c70c293ba610935efae0_cease%20to%20exist.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1VTaKud8PnviihT7xzwn7FvrXdV3GCEWYF/181""> Cease to exist </a>  refers to""my constant desire to end my life and just rest eternally""  Joanna. </figcaption></figure> Currently, Joanna's focus is to""shine a light on Tezos photographers"" whilst developing her own work to maintain the space's reputation as""an undiscovered mine of talent."" Eager to continue experimenting and sharing breathtaking cryptoart, Joanna appreciates how, through web3, she was able to""find people who relate to my art,"" adding that""they can buy it if they really vibe with it. This pushes me to make better art  "" for myself and the viewer.""  By drawing inspiration from the mundanity, nostalgia, and melancholy of everyday life and synthesising that with her own personal journey, Joanna's artwork sends a message to her audience that beauty can be found anywhere. Her artwork lends itself to the fantastical, the dreamlike, the surreal, to create transfixing and awe-inspiring works of art one can lose themselves in.  She concludes,""my art has to make me feel something, anything, even if for a brief, fleeting moment."" In sharing her art with the world, Joanna wants to share these feelings with you as well.

From botanics to blockchain  how Joelle McTigue became one of web3's most established artists,joelle mctigue,Wed Dec 28 2022 11:26:12,"Joelle McTigue's flare for travel has, quite literally, Lea Rose Emeryd her down many roads. One of the most esteemed artists in web3, she tells Mariquita de Boissiere de Bossii®re how she bloomed into a visual artist collected by gallerists and museums across the world, inspired by the power of travel and botanicals.",Wed Dec 28 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Communities-augmented,Photography; Travel; Abstract; North-America; Usa; Montengro,Mariquita de Boissiere," Joelle McTigue has never been one to take things at face value. Born in New York and raised in the Caribbean, the artist grew up surrounded by plush palm trees, crystalline waters, and white beaches. While the scores of tourists who flock to the US Virgin Islands year after year are swayed by the promise of sun, sea, and sand, for McTigue, it is the underlying crisscross of cultures and postcolonial histories that have instilled a sense of home'.  ""My island has had seven flags and is a mixture of all of the empires that have ruled here"", she explains. Despite being several thousand miles apart and on the other side of the world, McTigue discovered a familiar echo, years later, in the rich and varied cultural landscape of Montenegro's Bay of Kotor. She cites this resemblance as""the main reason why, even though you wouldn't think there would be a lot in common with the Caribbean and the Bay of Kotor, it's the first place that I felt truly at home travelling to.""  Shuttling between Los Angeles and Chicago, it was during her time as a student that she first picked up a camera and started exploring photography as a creative outlet. What she discovered was a means for interrogating her relationship with a particular place. Drawing upon the Situationist practice of the di©rive', made popular in the 1950s by the French philosopher, Guy Debord, McTigue would explore her surroundings through random wanderings.""It's about picking a place and not having a destination, or learning how to navigate a city according to how it has been built over time, not how it is set up today,"" she explains. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63ac720486ef99f4a0a1ef96_nft.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://foundation.app/@joellemctigue/jmctigue-cc/8"" > Placa de les Escoles Pies </a> ; photographed in Gandia, Spain; from Joelle McTigue's  Control and Cooperation  collection. </figcaption></figure> From the US, McTigue moved to Europe, where she spent the next four years travelling from city to city, spending no more than three months in any one of them. From Paris to Vienna, passing through Gandia and Belgrade, Joelle's unstructured walks continued to uncover the layers of subtext encoded within a city's architecture and across its urban planning.  Uncovering military history or quiet corners hidden within tourist traps, Joelle revelled in chancing across unexpected juxtapositions within well-known places. Paris' Luxembourg gardens is a favourite. Beneath the meticulously kept tree-lined promenades, verdant lawns, and fountain spots, the garden  considered to be the epitome of leisure  occults military origins.""When you research these places, more often than not, you discover it's a military site, a war spot,"" she divulges.   ""You can go from saying I want to do a show', to the show being up in ten days compared to, say, six months.""     Joelle McTigue   It is these contrasting themes of political and secular tourism that are central to her 2022 Foundation collection, <a href=""https://foundation.app/collection/jmctigue-cc"" > Control and Cooperation </a>. It also marks a creative turn for the Caribbean artist, who, inspired by Eames' 1977 mini-documentary<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0"" >  Powers of Ten </a>, began manipulating her images to explore scale and dimension.""Each piece is one of my street photos that I have stripped apart and put back together,"" she explains.""I'm focusing on how to flatten a space, and change both the literal perspective of it and the shapes that emerge as you work with the image.""  The result is a kaleidoscopic reimagining of space folded in on itself. By incorporating""documentative remnants"" snapped within sites of worship and civic governance, and refracting them into geometric forms, McTigue invites the viewer to engage with the familiar in unconventional ways. Digitised and minted on the blockchain, spectators are invited to explore the pieces up close. ""Most of them are rather large photos,"" she says.""You can zoom in and see the details. The photo taken in Gandia, Spain, really pulls together the botanicals in that series because, from far away, it looks like a flower bed seen from above. When you zoom in, however, you can see that it's actually a Roman Catholic brotherhood ritual taking place in the town square"". <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1428px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1428px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63ac7434580ec644ef101786_tunnel.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://www.1stdibs.com/nft/art/submarine-tunnel-mid-starboard-photograph-lustica-peninsula-montenegro-2018/id-n_tiu4dAAC1B/"" > Submarine Tunnel: Mid-Starboard </a> ; photographed in the Lustica Peninsula, Montenegro; from Joelle McTigue's  Submarine Tunnels  collection. </figcaption></figure> Whereas Europe's architectural halls of power form the basis for  Control and Cooperation , it is the Bay of Kotor's varied and vibrant plant life that stars as the subject of her <a href=""https://niftys.com/drops/cl07bkslg01000wl6bji8cxyv"" > Mediterranean Botanicals Collection </a>. The recurring botanical theme, initially inspired by European gardening rituals, is not coincidental: it threads each of her series together into""one big collection"".  The Covid-19 pandemic brought McTigue's travelling plans to an abrupt end while in the Bay of Kotor. Unperturbed, she responded by turning her attention to her local surroundings and its horticulture.""I became really curious about botanicals because, just outside my door, there are Cyprus palm trees. It got me asking, why are there so many different plants here that are not inherently from Montenegro?'""  ç ç While <a href=""https://www.1stdibs.com/nft/profile/joellemctigue/"" > Submarine Tunnels </a> and  Control and Cooperation  address the unstable identities of nations transitioning from war to peace, the  Mediterranean Botanicals Collection , featuring plants and flowers whose origins trace back to five different continents, tells a story of competing political powers, battling and collaborating with one another through invasion and trade.  Mediterranean Botanicals  narrates the horticultural imprints left by successive waves of empire as they swept through the bay over the centuries. ""My favourite is the <a href=""https://joellemctigue.com/work/#boka"" >Bengal Rose'</a>,"" McTigue confesses.""The Bengal rose, being from the Bay of Bengal, was brought by the Ottomans and sold in the bay to the Venetians. It is antiseptic, but was also used by rich Venetians to make rose oil gloves, because it was more chic to have those than a bath at the time,"" she laughs, adding,""you can almost guarantee that the rose bush ended up in the Bay of Kotor because two empires needed to trade in order to sustain their own war, wealth, and luxury.""  Inspired by her love for horticulture, McTigue began to dive into the Montenegro-inspired travelogues of the 17th century Turkish travel writer, Evliya iáelebi, allowing her to connect the varied plant life seen during her local walks to the country's rich history. At the same time, she was also connecting with communities in other geographical locations and time zones, through a burgeoning shared interest in web3.  Fascinated by how NFTs, made programmable through smart contract functions, can be considered""essentially dynamic paper"", it was the sense of community and punk-ish, DIY ethic found in web3 that reignited her creativity as an interdisciplinary artist.""Web3 reminds me a lot of LA when I first moved there. There was a very small art community. Even though it's a massive city, the big galleries hadn't moved in. It was just a scrappy indie art scene and I loved it.""  For artists looking to find their feet in web3, McTigue has the following words of advice:""I think almost everyone has their own little subculture pockets within web3. It might take a while to pinpoint your group, but you will find your fellow obsession-people'. I feel like all artists have a really deep obsession with something and that's so cool.""   ""Web3 reminds me a lot of LA when I first moved there.""    Joelle McTigue   McTigue's art can be said to reflect an obsession with time and space. Contrasting with the slow-shifting, century-spanning power dynamics captured through her reconstructed photography, the artist is excited by the accelerated learning and cultural expression that she sees in web3.  Breaking it down through the familiar lens of travel, she elaborates,""if you think of web3 as a new city that you move to in order to find your art group, it would normally take you months to attend all of the shows and figure out what is what. In web3, you can go through that process a lot faster. Absolutely everything's online. You can go from saying I want to do a show', to the show being up in ten days compared to, say, six months. That's wild to me."" ",2650

It was exhausting work. Participants would spend up to 15 hours a day in character.""If you want to be on set and emotionally hold a moment,"" she explains,""you have to have endurance and physical stamina."" It was during these workshops that her students gave Jordan the moniker the Soul Reader'. The filmmaker had an innate skill for seeing what motivated and inspired her actors, and what prevented them from reaching their potential. She helped them unblock. It was a gift that would guide her into NFTs and web3, ultimately leading her to the forefront of film3. But it took a decade.  Jordan stopped Permission Playground at the height of its success to focus on filmmaking proper. She started to move in circles where knowledge of crypto and, later, the nascent NFT culture were known. That said, the lightbulb didn't go off immediately.""I'm a filmmaker and I was far more interested in writing my films, making my films, getting my films financed.""

As the space explodes  and it will; it's too big an opportunity not to  there will be a lot of discussion about the term:  who  is film3,  what  is film3? Knowing the roots means that the term cannot be hijacked and the philosophy remains about ownership and community. With knowledge of the beginnings, film3 can give under-represented and marginalised filmmakers a choice they never had before: the choice to tell niche, fringe, difficult, dangerous, ambitious stories. The choice of opportunity and possibility where once there were only barriers and impediment.  The origins of film3 take filmmaking and storytelling beyond the handful of gatekeepers who green-light films. It gives a choice where there is no other choice. It's for everyone involved in filmmaking.""Part of the film3 ethos is a sustainable living for everyone,"" says Jordan, into her groove.""A more level playing field. More equitable for under-represented people and marginalised communities. Community, IP, ownership. These are the things that a filmmaker needs to understand. You have the freedom to hold your IP. Let's say you fund your movie with your community, because they believe in you. That is your audience. Plus, you're engaging them in the process, from the beginning, in a really cool way. They are built-in amplifiers, producers, and maybe even IP owners. Here, community is culture, community is the fuel, community is the change."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1664px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1664px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/631654775d49d8e9f75b56ed_JuliePacino_onSet.JPG"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > An  <a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xcb1021080b61dac7032618de925a62176cbc8372/1821""> on set shot </a>  from Keepers of the Inn, the first feature film funded by NFTs, written and directed by Julie Pacino. </figcaption></figure> But there is a hitch, an end-of-season cliffhanger: web3 isn't ready for film3, technologically.""I don't think film has come anywhere close to where it's going to be in web3,"" says Jordan, conscious of the obstacles.""Film doesn't interest developers so much."" The NFT Film Squad learnt this back in that first spotlight with David Bianchi.""It was the first time we'd heard about file size and compression issues.""  To give you an idea of the limitations, OpenSea has a 100MB maximum file size; Rarible has 30MB; Mintable 200MB; Foundation 50MB; SuperRare 50MB. By comparison, even an SD feature film weighs in at 2,000MB. A 90-minute film shot in 4K? No amount of compression is going to work right now. File size is the biggest obstacle to the true expansion of digital ownership, feature-length blockchain movies, and film3.  But more often than not, technology catches up with ambition, whilst filmmakers do not always need to store the whole film on-chain to build community-owned IP. So the future for Jordan, the NFT Film Squad, and the architects of film3 is to continue pushing the boundaries of the movement. To speak of IP ownership, community-led projects, and stories from the under-represented. To water the grassroots, to tell as many filmmakers and aspiring filmmakers as will listen about the philosophy and opportunity of film3. To ensure, as Jordan says, that""those who come into the film3 movement are additive, not extractive.""  Big studios are going to come in and they are going to have to figure out how to move. Will they change and integrate their own style? Jordan expects so.""Just like they did back at the beginning of independent film. Back in the early days of Sundance when all the studios were like woah look, indie film. We're going to have a whole indie film studio now'.""  Just six weeks after Jordan first tweeted #film3, she was invited to speak on a panel on the subject at The Cannes Film Festival. Whilst there, she asked if they knew where the term film3 had come from. Everyone said no. The movement had taken on a life of its own.  Yet film3 has much more untapped potential, and it needs someone who can help realise it. It needs a Soul Reader. ",3884

So, that was a pretty costly ruling from my boss!"" That prohibition against getting his hands dirty did not last. A few years later, by which point Josh had moved into in-house communications for mobile and other firms that, at the time, were cutting edge, Josh was at liberty to buy some crypto and start investigating the early NFT projects.  A scroll to the earliest days of Josh's wallet reveals eager breeding of CryptoKitties, trading cards in the Gods Unchained collection, alongside other prescient mints with the Decentraland metaverse and RTFKT, later acquired by Nike in December 2021. Alongside those mints came less long-lasting projects that did not survive through the various waves of the crypto chronology: collectibles and cultural projects like Apymon, Jabbaforms, and VoxoDeus, a film by the Arabian Camels that never made it big.  With so many ill-fated projects in the crypto ecosystem, it was not until the arrival of NBA Top Shot in early 2021 that Josh began to take NFTs seriously. It is this project, created by the original makers of CryptoKitties in partnership with the NBA, that he describes as a""gateway drug to NFTs"". Having always been a fan of physical trading cards, the idea of digital ownership and collecting had now clicked.""I was a collector before,"" he explains.""Anything from sports cards and trading cards to sneakers and streetwear. It was really fascinating to explore what that could look like in the digital world."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:631px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""631px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63c6b4eb2605a9d3f0874db0_josh%20ong.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Josh Ong's Bored Ape,  <a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/1037""> #1037 </a> . </figcaption></figure> His interest piqued; Josh began hosting web3-focused Twitter Spaces, and getting increasingly excited about how NFT holders could organically form their own communities.""I remember thinking about CryptoPunks,"" he says.""Even though it was this experimental art project, it created a form of membership. It became this credential within the crypto world.""  Not long after these musings, Josh's interests lined up with a new PFP project, set to take tokenised community building into the stratosphere: the Bored Ape Yacht Club. In a now familiar tale, he recalls minting his ape, tweeting about it, going to bed, and waking up to news that the collection had sold out and a new community was already taking shape.""People were going crazy in the Discord,"" he recalls.""Everyone was really excited about it. So, I just fired up some Spaces, like, hey, what's going on here? Let's take a look at the roadmap.'""   ""That summer really was magic  it attracted the curious.""    Josh Ong   The months following that initial mint were a golden time of experimentation and creativity, with the community playing an active role in shaping BAYC into the web3 icon it is today.""We had a lot of freedom as a community, as members of this club, to just explore,"" Josh says.""A lot of us minted and didn't even realise that we had commercial rights to our apes. So, we just talked it out together and people just started creating stuff. That summer really was magic  it attracted the curious.""  Of course, BAYC was not the first project to give commercial rights to holders but, as Josh points out, the sheer extent to which the community took that opportunity and ran with it stands out as a turning point for web3 and NFT communities. What began with derivative artworks has now grown into a sprawling metaverse that incorporates <a href=""https://punkscomic.com/elite-apes.html"">comics</a>,<a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/bored-and-dangerous"" > a novel</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/fcfbafc"" >fantasy sports teams</a>, and <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/champ-medici"">food franchises</a>; even <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/mtv-vmas-eminem-and-snoop-dogg-perform-as-bored-apes-in-the-metaverse/"">Eminem and Snoop Dogg</a> are now onboard. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63c6b5518e9a8907ff42b77b_BAYC.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > The Bored Ape Yacht Club clubhouse.  </figcaption></figure> Loosely tying everything together is the BAYC lore, an evolving narrative driven jointly by Yuga Labs and the community itself, the next chapter being <a href=""https://mdvmm.xyz/"" > The Trial of Jimmy The Monkey </a>, an interactive storytelling experience that brings new levels of sci-fi weirdness and seafaring ennui to the Bored Apes' universe this January.""What's really fun about BAYC lore right now is that it is collaborative,"" Josh says.""Canon in the Bored Ape world is achieved through consensus. In a way, it's not too dissimilar from how blockchains work: in order for lore to be accepted by the community, it has to be agreed upon.""  Perhaps therein lies the key to BAYC's rapid horizontal expansion: any member of the club can throw out ideas and start projects, but to scale up those initiatives, a member can access support from the wider community and Yuga Labs itself. It is that permissionless culture, coupled with consensus building, that empowered Josh to organise some of the first IRL meetups for BAYC, but it is the central spine of support that meant it quickly evolved into the totemic<a href=""https://apefest.com/"" > ApeFest</a> annual event. ""What I love is that we didn't need permission to gather the community,"" says Josh.""And after our first couple of meetups in LA and New York, I started hearing from Apes around the world saying, hey, I'm going to do a meetup in my city', and that's so much stronger than if you waited for BAYC to give the go ahead."" But nonetheless, mentioning the idea to Yuga Labs  Josh and his fellow BAYC Council member Peter Fang had originally planned to rent a rooftop  quickly demonstrated that their more radical idea was something that the central team would happily support.  And so it happened that ApeFest 2021 would take place on an actual yacht.""We brought it to the Yuga team, they said 'we'll fund it', and it ended up as Ape Fest,"" Josh summarises.""The initial idea for a festival was just 'we like doing meetups'. But we have this chance to go bigger; do we want to partner up with BAYC? The Yuga team took it and turned it into something bigger than what we could have built.""  Of course, all of this requires being part of the club, and the tension between maintaining the exclusivity that defines a community, whilst feeling inclusive for the millions who they hope to attract as fans is, says Josh, something that Yuga Labs and the community have consciously tried to balance.""When you create a boundaried community, through a limited token, there is an exclusivity to it,"" he acknowledges. ""For me, the idea was what does  inclusive   exclusivity  look like?', and what I found is that a lot of people who had minted Mutants had joined the space a little later, were super interested, but just weren't able to invest in an Ape. But they were able to get into the club at a more affordable level, and now some of those folks are incredible members of the community.""  Josh now takes a central role in helping to balance this dilemma, amongst many other concerns, with a seat on the new BAYC Council.""A lot of what we do is just to be present, to hear from and understand the needs of different community members around the world  and then bring that feedback to Yuga Labs and help them to think through what it means for their initiatives.""  In doing so, they help holders make the most of their IP by providing the central support that serves as a foundation for them to create something of their very own. For himself, a music graduate of UC Berkeley, Josh has been exploring the narrative around his own ape, Maui Prime, a budding producer. Most recently, Maui dropped his first track,<a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/4eleDC5q4V8X91ZRCveDll?si=7aa737d1809c4c85"" >  Clappin </a>, a collaboration with world-famous singer, songwriter, and rapper, Aloe Blacc.""We're thinking about what it looks like to create a virtual artist and to build a story around that,"" Josh explains.""I follow a lot of what isgoing on in music NFTs. There's so much potential there and it's a thread I'd love to continue pulling on.""   ‚Äç  ""Canon in the Bored Ape world is achieved through consensus.""    Josh Ong   Outside the realm of the Bored Apes, Josh is also the co-founder of Bored Room Ventures, a consulting and marketing agency that support the start-ups powering web3's next evolution.""I continue to be inspired by the new communities that have emerged in web3, and a lot of our investments are focused there. There are always the picks and shovels' companies trying to build new tools for this digital world, and we spend a lot of time on that. But also, some of it is just about continuing to dream big  saying hey, what is possible here and how can we support that?'""  In many ways, that is the attitude the has taken the Bored Apes to web3's loftiest heights. In barely 24 months, Yuga Labs and the BAYC community have redefined what is possible in web3, putting decentralisation into the global conversation. But as far as Josh is concerned, the journey is just getting started.""I think we're going to see some really amazing projects emerge, and a whole world of storytelling. It's going to be crazy.""

He left the corporate world behind, with a new plan""to do cool shit with cool people, have a lot of fun, and make an impact on the way."" The fun times came. And went. After building a smart contract company on Ethereum, he watched it go under in 2018 as the markets crashed.""I learned that being an entrepreneur is like being in a hardcore fight, every single day. It's not about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done: consistency, relentlessness, growth... every damn day.""  The underdog got back in the ring and founded <a href=""https://virtueanimation.com/"" >Virtue Animation</a>, a web3 studio that produces IP for the metaverse.

And of course, profit from it, should it become the next  South Park .  Web3 creates opportunities for communities to be involved well beyond fandom. Characters and stories weave together as ideas and the community grows.""The community is open, collaborative,"" Wags says.""There's this really cool energy: let's come together as a team."" It's interactive fandom, and rather than a community that cheers on from the sidelines, community is part of the source. A place where fans not only imagine, but actively contribute.   ""I want to be one of the pioneers.""    Josh Wagner   Millions descend on Comic Con and fan conventions every year. They crave inclusion and participation; to be part of the story. Web3 has the potential to make a reality from that fantasy, and <a href=""https://virtue-1.gitbook.io/basemint-bible/basemint-bible/product"" >Basemint Gang</a> is one of the first animated IPs to utilise its power. The exchange of ideas is swift; what works is ironed out in a Twitter Space or Discord, and what fails to meet the consensus of the community is unceremoniously dumped. In the five weeks since inception, the Basemint Gang has written and developed nine story episodes all set to be streamed on Rad.Live.   How can creators and artists further leverage the technical innovation of web3? Collaborations, tunes, and beats are everywhere in the Basemint Gang. Case in point? A 15-song soundtrack featuring 15 different artists. When royalty payments can be split onchain rather than go through a slew of paperwork, collaboration becomes a viable way to create. But not all of it will be immediately available. The team has gamified access to some songs and holders will have to complete challenges to unlock extra music traits embedded in their NFT.  Taking it further, could fans write songs for inclusion in the story? If the community digs the tune, could they be used? It is one of the many questions that web3 is asking and Virtue Animation is attempting to answer through Basemint Gang.  Community, creators, IP sovereignty, art, fun, rebellion. The pillars of web3 and NFTs.""I call it the degen-aissance. The renaissance bred amazing works of art and creativity and thought. We have the opportunity to enter an era like that.

He collated a list of films and the people involved, sent messages to every project, introducing them to the NFT Film Squad Spaces. In March, in the wake of South by Southwest - where the major studios had outlined their entry into the space - everything came to the fore. It was time for film3 to evolve: it needed a manifesto, a public declaration of philosophy and ambition before Hollywood plundered the movement.  With Jordan as chief architect and Jordan working on the business side, they set to work. It was at this time that the phrase film3' was first used. From there, it became about building out the Squad and its role in the ecosystem. ""By April, we were completely in sync and working on [events at] Cannes and NFT NYC.""  Julian came to cinema via velociraptors.""My mind was blown in 1993 by Jurassic Park."" Cue John Williams.""I was ten years old, I went five freaking times.

But the death throes started in 2005.""I fell out of love with movies because the experience wasn't there anymore."" Or maybe life took over?""I went into business, became an entrepreneur, and found I could do the most good in marketing.""

""Film3 and NFTs bring those DVD extras to life.""    Julian Flores   Miguel Faus wanted a web3 marketing strategy for Calladita.""In web2, if I want customers to buy a new thing, I'm going to place ads and copy and blog posts in a hundred different places.

Web3 has no traditional marketing funnel. You have one megaphone.""It's one vector. It's almost all happening on Twitter."" But as much as things change, they stay the same. Web3 hasn't changed human psychology (much), and the underlying principles apply. Storytelling still matters: Web3 marketing is about building relationships and unique experiences. It's about belonging and speaking directly with fans. The individual over the many.

The principle was simple: if you have 1,000 true fans who buy everything you create, you can earn enough to live comfortably as an artist. At the time, this was more an aspiration for the internet than a reality, an artistic strategy that the giants of web2 made almost impossible to execute. Web3, with Twitter as today's main channel of discovery, has made it a reality. Creators can curate their message and experiences around direct connections with fans, retain control of their IP, and avoid losing a huge cut to platforms in the middle.  That said, there are still limitations, especially for film3. Competition for attention means getting a 1,000 fans is only the start, whilst engaging them is no simple matter.""When you have a thousand fans, you have to invest a lot of time and nurture those relationships. You have to engage with them constantly."" And there is another problem: there isn't enough film3 to go around yet.""We don't have a thousand true fans for a hundred different projects. Not everyone can raise the funds necessary to build a team and create a project from NFT sales.""   ""There's no scale yet. It's almost all happening on Twitter.""    Julian Flores   The first NFT filmmakers, Julie Pacino and Miguel Faus, raised the better part of $800k each for  Keepers of the Inn  and  Calladita , respectively. But they are also outliers. Today, the obstacle of requiring Hollywood connections has been replaced by a new gatekeeper: a following on social media. It's simply not replicable at this time; at least not by many. What's the alternative?  Julian thinks strategically.""How do we stage the project to first get a founder's circle involved? Then, once we get them involved, how do we give them some value and then expand to the next circle of folks? How do we create the next milestone in the project?""  Movie milestones, sequentially built communities that grow at each point on the roadmap, leading up to an NFT drop rather than following a drop built on hype alone. Ultimately, it comes down to one thing:""how do we build something together over six months and then lead up to the fundraising part?""  If film3 is to really disrupt the legacy model and the ruling class of Hollywood moguls to get films made that otherwise would never reach the studio, then not only does film3 need a place where communities can come together to create, contribute to, and own the next story, it needs someone who knows how to get them together. And that person doesn't necessarily need to know how to make a film. ",3172

Despite the almost overnight success, Julie is acutely aware of the space's limitations  and the potential of a toxic positivity that can place suffocating demands on artists.  ""It was, to me, a moment of realising the areas in which I could live a more truthful life.""    Julie Pacino  ""Your timeline gets flooded with all the victories,"" she explains,""it's only people's wins. I guess that's just social media in general. And I've fallen victim to that and have recently been honestly pretty fried by the whole space."" Setting boundaries on social media use has been a helpful tool, but so has been reminding herself of one simple truth:""it's okay if you're not feeling good about what's going on in your life."" It is OK to not be OK, even if your timeline is telling you otherwise.  There is a clear-eyed self-assurance in Julie, one that may be down to the lockdown soul-searching that many artists grappled with.""I did a lot of writing and a lot of self-realisations happened through that writing,"" she says.""I think it was, to me, a moment of realising the areas in which I could live a more truthful life."" This awareness enabled a""surge of creative energy on a professional level and on a personal level"" as she came out of the pandemic. That meant embracing herself and""being proud of the artwork that I was making and the stories I wanted to tell, that dealt with themes of sexual identity and womanhood."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6386145a9b4be0365189d669_julie-pacino-tow-the-line.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/107431263592480299811499235302818049319062692943160370239942642556131874963457"" target=""_blank""><em>Tow The Line </a><em>, by Julie Pacino, from 'I Live Here Now'. </figcaption></figure> While on one hand web3 has given Julie a huge platform for expression, that same clear-sightedness makes her acutely aware of the barriers to the space, which has an immense potential for democratisation and visibility as well as significant frictions when it comes to onboarding others, as Julie discovered herself.""I kind of spent a couple months lurking and not really actively participating, but just vibing it out and trying to educate myself. It was a real process for me.""  Julie hopes that in the future the technology will become less intimidating  and easier to use.""That is what stopped me from getting into the space for many months. Just because it was scary with 'crypto' and 'MetaMask' and 'decentralisation'  and these horror stories of people like losing millions of dollars because they accidentally sent their money to the wrong address."" Julie recalls the story of how her mother lost her seed phrase, only to ask Julie to""call up the blockchain"" to get it back.""These are things that now (still) seem so crazy to me, but before I was immersed in this, were just so terrifying.""   This complexity is a huge barrier to onboarding others  and she hopes mainstream media can help bridge the gap and begin to illustrate how easy it is to enter the space. Because once that barrier is overcome, Julie sees a huge potential not just as a platform, but as a place of recognition and worth.""I think as web2 artists we are often conditioned to believe that our work has no value, that our artwork has no value  with ridiculous royalty offers for photographers, and especially as under-represented voices, women and LGBTQ, BIPOC,"" she argues. ""We're all conditioned to think that anyone that buys our art is doing us a favor."" With web3, she was overwhelmed by the demand for her work  and remembers that first thrill when her pieces first started being collected:""it's the best feeling in the world, seriously. Just thinking someone wanted to buy my JPEG.""  Having traversed new ground and synthesised the world of NFTs and film, Julie shows no signs of slowing down. She is at the forefront of this new area of""creative freedom"" that's been dubbed film3.  ""That's coined by Jordan Bayne, who's an amazing film-maker in the space; she founded the NFT Film Squad. I think that the main thing is complete control and I know that there are producers and filmmakers coming into this space looking to exploit that.""    ""It's the best feeling in the world, seriously.""    Julie Pacino   Keeping that creative control  and a high bar for artistic integrity  will be key as bigger players try to come into the market.""If I'm able to go out there, put together this high concept, shoot, pour my heart and soul into it, and make this artwork that I'm really proud of that I think can stand the test of time, then, I would imagine that any studios coming into this space trying to put a drop together can have the resources to do the same. And we should hold them to that. The artwork should come first and it should matter.""  At the moment, she's doing what she can in the bear market, focusing on finishing a new draft of her screenplay and moving toward pre-production. She's also experimented with a new direction with her SuperRare campaign, which has given her the space to explore herself and her story in greater depth. With two photographs minted so far, the collection""is really a study on the female gaze and the female form and photographing women; photographs of women, by women, and how photography is a tool for me to embrace my own sexual identity"".  She knows how imperative the female lens is in the web3 space  a place where, she believes""wholeheartedly"" that equality can be achieved and that""real change can happen"". She's aware that this utopia is some distance away for now, but is plotting the path to get there.""I've also realised how much of a boys club it still is and that equality is a bit further away than I thought when I first got into it. I think that what we need to do is onboard more of these representatives into this space.""  She's committed to helping make that change happen.""That's where I've shifted my focus now, trying to see who in the web2 world I have a connection with that has deep pockets, that has similar values as I do, that can come in and start to open up opportunities, lucrative opportunities, for underrepresented voices.""  But Julie is realistic about the work still to be done  a challenge from which she is not shying away.""I'm just reminding myself and anyone else that comes to me to vent: we're building long term and there's such comfort in that.""

" ""I like to think of my art as a way to filter life""  Kidmograph: Apple, Justin Bieber, and now web3 ",kidmograph,Sun Aug 28 2022 18:41:55,"Born to a technical botanical artist and a stained-glass window painter, Kidmograph has worked with the likes of Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, and Apple, his digital art and 3D GIFs portraying futuristic and acid-inducing surrealism. He speaks to Steph Kunkel Kunkel about experimenting with a plethora of mediums, his creative approach, and why NFTs are a much needed innovation.",Tue Aug 30 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,3d-Art; Digital-Art; Motion-Graphics; Vr-Ar,Steph Kunkel," Inspired by his drive to express universal feelings through a unique voice, Kidmograph produces art embedded in the untapped potential of human nature, with a forward-looking perspective on what humanity and the future can be. Heralding from La Plata, Argentina, the illustrator known as Gustavo Fernando Torres communicates his ideas through a variety of shapes, modes, and mediums  from AI and animation to 3D art, and various other ventures in digital art and visual effects, including music videos and production for Justin Bieber, Christina Aguilera, Nas, Maroon 5, and The Weeknd.  Kidmograph's digital style blends the timeline with references from the past and inferences of the future, blurring the lines between time, reality, and the virtual world. Inspired by elements of science fiction and the 80s and 90s, he creates hyper-realistic artwork that evokes an alternative and dystopian feel; yet also a sense of nostalgia.  An artist from his roots and in his blood, Kidmograph grew up in a highly multi-disciplinary family. His father was a technical botanical artist, musician, painter, and graphic designer; his mother an illustrator, printer, and stained-glass artist. Having grown of age in that environment, he was never one for the traditional route. He dropped out of his undergraduate degree in painting and design in the late 90s, finding it to be""pointless and trivial"". In pursuit of a more liberated experience as a creator, he also quit""traditional art"", shortly after the turn of the century.""The traditional art scene is tainted by contacts, shallow connections, and biases. I really disliked that, and I felt that I was losing my time trying to fit into a deprecated system.""  Instead, Kidmograph immersed himself in the digital world, learning the software, diving into the ecosystem to find gigs online, and eventually producing work for the likes of Apple, Instagram, Adidas, and Gucci. He felt more comfortable in this world, which recognised his artistic talent and gave him a platform to build a name for himself, rather than for his clients. In the early 2000s, Kidmograph immersed himself in Tumblr and Instagram, creating GIFs, videos, and animations to showcase his work. As a digital-native, the step to NFTs was a natural one, given the opportunities for ownership, experimentation, and collaboration in web3. An avid researcher in the field and with a passion for learning new technologies, Kidmograph jumped into the space eager to learn more about the potential for blockchains and smart contracts to democratise the art world. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1080px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1080px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/637eaa60b7bcee1a00efbb6d_EB.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > A frame from ENTER:BRAIN, which featured in an augmented reality NFT pop-up book, produced by  <a href=""https://twitter.com/sutu_eats_flies""> Sutu </a> . </figcaption></figure> Influenced by the background of old anime and the hand-style drawing, ENTER:BRAIN showcases the timeline of a single thought. As Kidmograph describes it,""the piece activates' once you put your phone camera over the illustration. The head opens up and the narrative starts.""   ""I like to think of my art as a way to filter life.""    Kidmograph   The AI turns to life for a moment, exhibiting the activation of the brain and thought. We see an animated and theatrical representation of human thought in the subconscious mind. Framed by the use of animation and technicolour, ENTER:BRAIN is a discourse on artificial intelligence and the evolution of human thought as a linear process. Maybe one day our thoughts will not be a clear, linear narrative, but, rather, an explosion of impromptu thoughts of varying stages of coherence, slowly collapsing and expanding on themselves, thought by thought, one on top of another.  ""I like to think of my art as a way to filter life  I can't think of a way where both art and life are not intertwined."" Kidmograph explains that, for him, art and life feed on one another; the ability to express himself through his artistic approach makes his days meaningful and worthwhile.   Despite his vibrantly upbeat and optimistic perspective, he admits to, like we all do, sometimes feeling mad, frustrated, lonely, sad, or angry. He believes that different techniques and approaches help us to express ourselves in a visual language. For Kidmograph, experimenting in art helps him find""new ways to exteriorise our feelings."" He describes this as a""mindfulness act,"" tapping into his emotions through his artwork.""For several moments, I can forget everything and just do, just be,"" he says. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:533px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""533px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/630e086b4b5969082f89d407_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(2).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://www.niftygateway.com/marketplace/collection/0xc8eaa173cf4516cd95048638028db2896f8e10f4/1?filters[onSale]=true&sortBy=lowest""> Recognition Tunnel D37 </a> , by Kidmograph. </figcaption></figure> With over two decades of experience in digital art, Kidmograph primarily uses two generated modes for his creative process. The first method involves chasing what he describes as a""vague idea, feeling, or vision  something blurred and unclear in shape but strong in feeling."" This transitions into him sketching shapes and concepts and ultimately building the assets on his computer through different types of software, like Photoshop and Unreal Engine.  The second method is reliant on his vivid imagination. Here, Kidmograph has a clear and specific situation that is an already-completed artwork in his mind. The struggle is trying to recreate this vision into a finalised piece.""Sometimes it works, other times, not so well, but serendipity' often happens, meaning that I create something unexpected and different to what I had anticipated.""   Working in both traditional 2D illustration and animation, as well as 3D, involves the complex process of hand-drawn ideas, detailed scenes (particularly for 3D), and, for music videos, compositing.""I'm always interested in how things work and like to create everything from scratch when the budget and time permit.""  Kidmograph believes it is crucial for the web3 community to concentrate on the concepts of provenance and ownership in order to continue to build stability and community for artists of the future.""As a craftsman, I do love to work on several projects with many people around the world, and that will not change for me."" His experience  shared by <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/julie-pacino"" >artists of all mediums</a>  of the battle for attribution and the devaluation of his work on the internet, is one he is keen to move away from. ""When we posted GIFs, or even videos, on Tumblr ten years ago, artists had to constantly fight about the uncredited posts, false attributions, and overall bad usage  it was an uphill battle. Web3 can be a potential fix for this, and though the economic aspect is not my first priority, of course, who doesn't want to earn 100 times more via digital currency after being underpaid for years?"" He adds,""the web3 revolution is a big door for many people that didn't have a space before, and lots of new artists are emerging.""  Always at the forefront of emerging technologies, Kidmograph is excited by how digital art is gaining attention in traditional galleries. Today he is shifting his focus to motion graphics, one of which includes a cartoon-type pilot based on his <a href=""https://www.niftygateway.com/collections/areakidmograph"" >AREA</a> collection on Nifty Gateway. As always, his other ambitions stretch across multiple mediums: a movie title credit, a retro-futuristic video game, and continuing to explore one of his most prominent interests  holograms and augmented reality ""as a way to get a closer experience between the art and the spectator.""   Kidmograph's art acts as a portal, a bridge opening life and inspiration to the possibility of new worlds. He can see the world as it truly is in the present and the foresight into what the world could be.""I believe that we as human beings can connect through different ways of expression, regardless of geography, governments, or economic situations,"" he suggests.""Art is a gathering point.""

Lamina1 and Klatyn: exploring the blockchains of the open metaverse ,lamina1 and klatyn blockchains of the open metaverse,Thu Nov 24 2022 13:05:44,A metaverse owned by companies taking a cut will never reach its full potential. Open metaverses built on decentralised blockchains unlock new possibilities for creativity and commerce that would not be realised in a centralised experience. Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg contrasts two organisations building the early stages of that vision.,Tue Nov 22 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Metaverse,Blockchain; Layer-1s; Lamina1; Klaytn; Infrastructure,Randy Ginsburg," What the metaverse will become, no one knows. And while many companies have their guesses, one thing is certain: a metaverse owned by a single company is far from favorable.  There is <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/webaverse"" >strong demand</a> for an open-source metaverse in which companies and users alike have ownership over the content they create. But how the infrastructure upon which an open-source metaverse would be built remains an open question. Will it thrive on a layer one blockchain like Ethereum? An interconnected network of application-specific chains like <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/cosmos"" >Cosmos</a>? A combination of the two?  Companies like Lamina1 and Klaytn anticipate a different future, where blockchains designed specifically for the metaverse dominate sector.  But while Lamina1 and Klaytn are similar in theory and sector, each company is taking a radically different approach to the market. While Klatyn builds for enterprises, those most likely to drive metaverse into the mainstream, Lamina1 puts creators at the forefront of its vision.  In a sense that's no surprise. A team of experienced builders in web3 augmented reality, and internet of things, Lamina1 is co-founded and chaired by Neal Steph Kunkelenson, author of the 1992  Snow Crash  fantasy novel which defined how many in web3 understand the metaverse today. The author and physicist's metaverse company was always going to integrate creativity into its core vision, with its multi-pronged approach to a creator-focused metaverse comprising the main blockchain, a metaverse-as-a-service tech stack, and economic incentives for creator and community participation. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1920px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1920px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/637f771381bce24fa3623294_ns.webp"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > An author, augmented reality founder, and a former executive at Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin, Neal Steph Kunkelenson ideated the term 'metaverse' and the vision behind it in his 1992 sci-fi novel Snow Crash. Photo: Geraint Lewis/Redux. </figcaption></figure> In creating its main blockchain, Lamina1 has partnered with the Avalanche blockchain to employ a proof-of-stake chain customised to support content creators.  For the open metaverse to thrive, argues Steph Kunkelenson's co-founder Peter Vessenes, it must provide high-scale infrastructure and payments support to sustain the creator economy. These tools will allow users to easily distribute rights payments amongst hundreds of thousands of recipients, each contributors to the open metaverse, safely paying them and allowing the metaverse to evolve into a truly community-created experience.  But to fuel this commerce, there must also be communication. Lamina 1 is focused on building an onchain messaging solution to enhance not only the coordination of numerous payments and smart contract interactions, many of which need to register almost instantly to make a game playable, but the sustainability of the entire ecosystem. For the metaverse to truly become a place where people can socialise, shop, learn, and play, latency-free communication isn't a nice to have, it's a necessity. Without free-flowing communication, the premise of the open metaverse is defeated entirely. <br>  Beyond its dedicated mainnet, Lamina1 plans to bridge the vast ecosystem of layer one and layer two blockchains with a toolbox of interoperable and decentralised services that enables anyone to create a metaverse experience. The goal? Make the open metaverse as fast, scalable, and accessible as possible. All applications built using Lamina1's Metaverse-as-a-Service stack will give developers access to a data storage layer, cloud and hybrid rendering, and seamless integration with game engines and web browsers.  To power the expansion of their community ecosystem, Lamina1 is investing heavily in community participation initiatives through funding Lamina creators and original Lamina IP. It is this content and community of makers that Lamina hopes will fuel its growth, driving fans and spending directly to the ecosystem. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1656px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1656px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/637f77ddbebb0a6456985777_lamina1-d_sagaVkV-transformed.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><em>Lamina1's aim is to provide communities with infrastructure, not gatekeepers, to build a more immersive internet. </figcaption></figure> Meanwhile, Klaytn sees a different road to the open metaverse: developing the enterprise-layer, onboarding major web2 players, and letting them bring web3 to everyone else.  A subsidiary of leading South Korean internet and messaging corporation Kakao, <a href=""https://www.klaytn.foundation/"" >Klatyn</a> is aiming its own proof-of-stake open metaverse chain at commercial clients. Because of this focus on major enterprises, Klaytn is built to deliver solutions that work as quickly as the web2 incumbents they are competing against, with near-instant finality.  They achieve this through employing a hub-and-spoke scaling model, where enterprises can create their own service chains (also known as sidechains) tailored for their specific application. Each service chain is anchored to Klatyn's mainnet and can be nested within one another, creating additional hub-and-spoke sets primed for exponential scalability by distributing the load that each chain has to carry.  At the start of 2022, Klatyn became compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing protocols from other Ethereum-compatible environments to run seamlessly with virtually no changes in the code, making it easier for developers to build products in the Klaytn ecosystem.  But like all things in life, there are tradeoffs. What Klaytn brings in speed, scalability, and compatibility, it lacks in decentralisation. The Klaytn network is largely secured by the Klatyn Governance Council, a group of 19 validators comprising mostly Kakao subsidiaries. Meanwhile, one of the few web3-focused organisations to sit on the governing council was Alameda, until the now-disgraced crypto trading firm declared bankruptcy alongside its sister exchange FTX (Kakao itself was not financially impacted by organisation's collapse).  Acknowledging the benefits of decentralisation and transparency, Klaytn is actively looking to bolster the security and transparency of its chain, aiming to increase the total number of Governance Council members to 50, with 15 of these being DAOs, whilst developing a more transparent onchain governance process.  What Klaytn brings in speed, scalability, and compatibility, it lacks in decentralisation.   Nonetheless, the advantages of pursuing scalability over decentralisation has helped Klaytn build an expansive developer ecosystem and ink partnerships with major web3 players. OpenSea integrated with Klaytn in early 2021, making it the first blockchain beyond Ethereum, where almost all NFT sales occur, to be supported by the world's biggest NFT marketplace, whilst over 50 game developers have committed to launching applications on Klaytn.  Since its inception, Klaytn has remained steadfast in providing developers with wallet products to improve the user experience, block explorers which make public blockchain data truly accessible, APIs to support developers, and bridges to let users move their assets across different chains. With easy access to these resources, alongside other products like oracles to verify offchain data, developers can spend less time building complex infrastructure and more time building quality applications.  As the developer environment continues to grow, the Klaytn Foundation plans to build a more extensive metaverse package for developers, including pre-built smart contract libraries and software development kits to help developers bring their ideas to life.   It's too early to tell which, if either, blockchain will cement itself as a pioneer of the open metaverse, but Lamina and Klaytn are currently at the forefront of efforts to define what the metaverse looks like in reality. That in itself is a valuable contribution for a sector that has remained little more than a fantasy novel to date. ",2443
How poet and actor Laurence Fuller is changing the way we tell stories,laurence fuller,Sun Jun 19 2022 16:52:41,"An actor, poet, producer, and composer, Laurence Fuller is part of a community of artists carving out space for poetry in web3. He sat down with Leo Nasskau to talk about the interplay between culture, poetry, film, and web3; Li©a Rose Emery tells the story.",Mon Jun 20 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Storytelling,Poetry; Animation; Film; Usa; North-America,Lea Rose Emery," ""I think a universal will always be universal: what is essentially pleasurable to the human eyes and ears will never change, but the ways of telling those stories absolutely is changing every day."" If there is one person adapting to those changes at lightning speed, it's Laurence Fuller. The actor, producer, writer, and poet saw the potential of NFTs in an instant  and embraced the space with enthusiasm, curiousity and, perhaps most importantly, a deeply embedded instinct for how to tell stories. ""I'd been doing theatre and film up until that point of moving into web3. I had a lot of experience in the art world as well, in the family business,"" Laurence explains.""When lockdown happened, I was already a bit in crypto and a lot in writing poetry and making films."" He took the period to expand his literary horizons. He wrote a novella,  The Fortune , about whaling in Leith Harbour, while delving deeper into poetry and finishing the screenplay about his late father,  Modern Art which would go on to be celebrated on the screenwriting circuit.  But in the midst of his creative spurt, the first moment he heard about NFTs still burns bright in his mind.""I was like, Oh my God, that's like, that's it'. It just blew my mind open. I think that energy and that moment of revelation of what it could be has never really died.""  With that, Laurence hit the ground running, immersing himself""24/7"" in the web3 space after minting his first spoken word poetry and art collaboration in March 2021. Captured by the boundary-pushing, interdisciplinary potential of the space, he fused the mediums of poetry and art in a way that he hadn't been able to realise in traditional forms.""It just wasn't really a doable thing, in the art world, in the traditional world, in the worlds that I come from, in the world of Netflix and Amazon, or even in commercial galleries."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" style=""max-width:50%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright"" data-rt-max-width=""50%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62af50f60c4ca4c854b23ca1_IMG_7581.jpeg"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" > <figcaption > Laurence Fuller is one of the handful of artists defining poetry in the NFT medium. </figcaption></figure> Dubbed <a href=""https://www.ledger.com/the-ledger-podcast/laurence-fuller-the-nft-poet"" > ""the first NFT poet""</a>, Laurence not only combines mediums, he seeks to synthesise the old and new, the classics and technology.  ""Initially it was just painting in poetry because I was very inspired by Baudelaire and my late father's writings, who both were just passionate writers about art and were really trying to find the connection between writing and painting. Baudelaire has some amazing poems about paintings and painters... I just have always thought that if he had the technology, he would take it further.""  And Laurence certainly takes it further. NFTs have given him the space to move beyond the discussion of how poetry and art are linked  and provided a space to explore, play, and create. His curiousity and deft hand are evident in works like <a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/114390399022975618490334883382040180200974747086540559856468126843879695581185"" >The Signature</a>, where subtle animation of a Vermeer painting, crafted with an anonymous poem performed by Laurence, melds new words with old masters.  But while celebrating and exploring the past, Laurence is excited by the future of the NFT space  not just as an evolving medium, but as a vehicle for emerging talent. Already an established actor (being a Heath Ledger scholar and having recently played the iconic painter David Hockney in  MINX  from HBO Max), Laurence sees huge potential in the relationship between NFTs and film, most notably shorts, which share the pioneering artistic spirit inherent within NFTs. ""It's surprising there isn't a short film platform already where you can buy an NFT of a short film,"" he explains.""That would be perfect because the ecosystem for short films and the festival circuit has always been emerging and always been sort of roll up your sleeves and get it done'. It's all about the talent and the art and putting passion into it, almost a showcase for, this is who I am as a filmmaker'.""  ""I just have always thought that if he had the technology, he (Baudelaire, the poet) would take it further.""    Laurence Fuller   To Laurence, NFTs are not just a platform to highlight yourself as an artist, they're a platform where artists recognise, support, and amplify each other. And a community has grown through that shared ethos.""My collaborators and my collectors: we've all really risen together this past year. It's amazing to see everyone's follower count grow and their influence grow. And we're all sharing each other's works or a collector's point of view. To see my good friend Tanya Rivilis winning the top awards  "" she just won the Royal Society of Portraiture award  "" incredible, it's like winning an Oscar.

Pointing out that the list of the top 200 collectors contains barely a handful of artists, Laurence explains that""this impression comes about because it is  possible  for artists to collect other artists because there is no gas and because artist discovery is so good, but we absolutely have a lot of entrepreneurs and business people and collectors out here.""  Instead, it's the community of artists that has attracted a broader collector ecosystem, even if it's the artists that are more active on Twitter. Laurence has witnessed this community growing in real-time, welcoming to opportunity to see art celebrated for being""just great art,"" artists and celebrated for their craft, even if they do not come from a place of privilege. And he is ready to push forward the capacity and momentum of the space in any way he can.  Next up is an arresting and ambitious collaboration with Val Kilmer, continuing to explore the interlinking of forms of expression.""After he recovered from cancer he's no longer really able to use his voice as well and to perform as much,"" Laurence says.""He's been a renaissance man all his life and did a lot of paintings and poetry, and so I've been asked to give voice to his poetry with what I do in poetry and art collaborations."" The first three pieces will be a collaboration with Michele Petrelli, Tanya Rivilis, and Goldcat, featuring portraits of Val in the settings of his poetry. <br>  With an enormous breadth of ideas and projects in the pipeline, there is a determined propulsion to Laurence.

Bonsai on blockchain: how Lawrence Rogers is innovating with fully onchain art,lawrence rogers,Fri Sep 30 2022 18:02:06,"An ex-Googler, Lawrence toyed with the idea of working at a start-up after Lea Rose Emeryving the web2 giant. But after delving deeper into web3, the technologist and creative saw a chance to combine both interests in NFTs. He talks to Steph Kunkel Kunkel about bringing collaboration and time into his art, creating entirely generative and onchain pieces, why smart contract technology is revolutionary.",Fri Sep 30 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Generative,Steph Kunkel," A ten-year-old boy huddles over his graphing calculator, coding. He experiments with particle effects and physics theory, uncovering a new passion and an entirely new world. In high school, the Kentucky native codes an Android game with his friends that thousands of users pay to play. Lawrence Rogers then went off to Stanford and built his career at Google, peak web2, before pivoting to web3 to embrace the disruption wrought by smart contracts across art and beyond.   Last year, Lawrence set out on his own start-up to incorporate blockchain into video games, but found streamers were hesitant to promote crypto games. Looking to pivot, Lawrence dived further down the rabbit hole, researching how blockchain engineering and smart contracts were reinventing industries from the ground-up, rather than just adding something new on top. He quickly became enthralled in the web3 space and decided to make another pivot. This time, to art.  Lawrence wasn't new to artistry. In the past, he'd done everything from music and painting to the less familiar, designing custom wedding rings and building his own furniture. An artist as well as a builder, it gave Lawrence a unique point-of-view in his NFT work; a creative and a technologist.    ""Can I create an NFT that lives and grows over time?""     Lawrence Rogers   His genesis project,  Jackson , was inspired by a video about bonsai trees. Lawrence tells me of one bonsai that has lived for a thousand years and recently sold for a high price.""What makes one bonsai tree so valuable?"" I asked. Lawrence smiled,""The bonsai tree is reflective of its past."" This was what prompted Lawrence to ask a question that has influence the trajectory of his creative intent  "" and his career trajectory more broadly:""can I create an NFT that grows over time?""  In pursuit of his vision, Lawrence began generating algorithms that would portray a bonsai tree changing and growing over time.""I wanted to build something completely on-chain. I thought, the more on-chain, the more native with web3 blockchain art, the art will exist and live for a long time,"" Lawrence says. The collection website <a href=""https://www.jacksonnft.xyz/#:~:text=as%20long%20as%20ethereum%20exists%20and%20web%20browsers%20can%20read%20svg%20images%2C%20you%20will%20be%20able%20to%20view%20and%20grow%20your%20jackson."">proudly declares</a>,""As long as Ethereum exists and web browsers can read SVG images, you will be able to view and grow your Jackson."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:881px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""881px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63373058a957286d79d2de66_jackson%20duck.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x877bec43dd0e3555eda424e0e0601ed0750aa3cc/28""> Jackson #28 </a> , christened ""the duck"" by the Jackson community. </figcaption></figure> The name 'Jackson' comes from Jackson Pollock, known for creating brush strokes of different textures. It gave him the initial to simulate 1,000 NFTs with 30 random strokes each, though as Lawrence viewed the collection in order, it didn't feel right. The strokes weren't varied enough, whilst the final product was too busy. He wanted variety, evident uniqueness, and complexity. After dozens of iterations and tweaks, he finally reached his decision.  Lawrence created  Jackson  as a 100% on-chain generative art project that grows over time, with each new mint adding a new block to their own canvas, as well as up to twenty of those before it. (The first ten minters have the perk of receiving every new block.) The intention was to grow over time: pieces would gain new brush strokes as more Jacksons are minted, though the collection sold out in 7 minutes.  Collectors could also customise their stroke through a custom mint functionality. Lawrence considered removing the ability to create unique brush strokes,""What if someone creates a black box and attempts to ruin the collection?"" In the end, Lawrence decided to keep the customisation element and someone did create a black box, <a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x877bec43dd0e3555eda424e0e0601ed0750aa3cc/308""> Jackson #308 </a>, which encompassed the entire canvas, but it didn't turn out the way you'd expect.""It's part of the experiment and the customisation adds a unique element to the collection.""  Once the collectors mint their pieces, their unique brush stroke will be added to previously minted canvases, evolving their canvas into a new piece of art. Then collectors can sit back and watch their canvas grow. As others minted their Jacksons, each canvas collects brush strokes and evolve over time.""You can see whose mint it came from, each stroke, <a href=""https://www.jacksonnft.xyz/browse/39"">on the website</a>; you can see all the Jacksons you've painted on,"" Lawrence explains.  Inspired by the bonsai, Lawrence was drawn to the idea of aging art, and how anything, even a tree, can hold multiple stories over its lifetime.""One of the promises of blockchains is eternity. As web3 and NFTs evolve, change, and interact over time, it can really influence the opportunity to combine longevity and prosperity.""   Jackson  embodies the experimentation in web3, utilising collaboration  "" he's keen for his smart contract to serve as inspiration for other generative artists  ""  community mints, and generative work. In doing so,  Jackson  peers into the future of the potential and promises that web3 holds. Lawrence gives us a collection where we can track  Jackson  in all its stages of life and watch it evolve; we see  Jackson  in the past, present, and future. He is currently working on V2 to continue the its evolution and his future NFT projects even over time, even after the mints are completed.  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:890px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""890px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/633745671f2a399e84a6509d_jacon308.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x877bec43dd0e3555eda424e0e0601ed0750aa3cc/308""> Jackson 308 </a>  was a customised brush stroke  a black square that engulfed the canvas. Based on the collector's wallet, their generated brushstroke would have been a large blue vertical rectangle in the left-hand corner of the piece. </figcaption></figure> At 157 eth in volume,  Jackson  is by far Lawrence's most successful project, but the follow-up to his genesis,  MergeFlowers , takes collaborative, generative art into new territory. A compilation of 850 on-chain flowers that bloomed upon the completion of the merge, turning collaborative art into a collaborative experience. Pre-merge, all flowers appeared as green buds, their traits hidden. Post merge, the flowers bloom, revealing the unique trait combinations underneath. This process allows the collector to mint their own unique flower, be a part of the minting process, and watch their flower bloom alongside others, marking a historic moment in unison. This progression gives the project life, echoing the lifecycle of natural flowers   growing, changing, living.   ""One of the promises of blockchains is eternity.""    Lawrence Rogers   Lawrence is currently building on his ideas from  Jackson  and  MergeFlowers  while continuing to combine his generative art with smart contracts to explore how blockchain technology can enhance interactive digital art that tells stories over time. He's exploring new ideas for creative minting processes and hopes to include more interactive elements to enhance artist collaboration and community engagement. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center"" style=""padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""33.723653395784545%"" data-rt-dimensions=""854:480"" data-page-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFlI3PzoKZU""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/kFlI3PzoKZU"" title=""MergeFlowers Animation Samples""></iframe> </figure> In particular, Lawrence is taking what he's Lea Rose Emeryrnt back to gaming, working to make the space easier to access, trust, and enjoy. He's currently working on an NFT Space Invaders minigame designed to grow over time. Each collector will mint their own spaceship, with various features based on the gamer's wallet address much like for  Jackson , though a lot more intricate in design variations, visualisations, and how interactive the assets are. And the Invaders that players are tasked to battle? They are volunteers from the players themselves: those who mint can enter by colour, size, or speed.   ""Are there new concepts we can use to create interactive and collaborative art?""    Lawrence Rogers   Lawrence believes that utilising these interactive elements creates a sense of excitement and embodies what web3 is all about  "" the evolution of art over time and the interactive story being told."" Jackson  could have ended up very different without the algorithms and smart contract, but each piece and brush stroke has a meaning. This brush stroke is this colour because you were the 40th person to mint, or the brush is based on your wallet address, which provides a sense of identity to each collector.""  When creating new work, Lawrence always asks himself,""are there new kinds of art that we could not make before? Are there new concepts we can use to create interactive and collaborative art?"" Lawrence urges other artists to do the same, creating pieces that are unique to that specific collector. Ultimately, he makes us stop and wonder: what is the purpose of this NFT being on-chain? As it turns out, there are many answers to that question. ",2852
Leslie Spurlock on capturing truth through photography NFTs,leslie spurlock on capturing truth through photography nfts,Thu Jan 19 2023 17:09:08,"From Haiti to Minneapolis, Leslie Spurlock's career in photojournalism has been spent documenting some of the world's most important events. She spoke with Ola Kalejaye Kalejaye about the challenges of the profession, why web3 has made her see her work differently, and the importance of telling the truth. ",Thu Jan 19 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Storytelling,Photography; Photojournalism; Activism,Ola Kalejaye," Leslie Spurlock is the kind of woman whose life experiences could easily be played out on the big screen; such is the life of an artist seeking out stories amid warzones, floods, and explosive historical protests.  Leslie began to hone in on photojournalism during her time at photography school. Studying in the 1980s, a decade in which the USSR's attempted invasion of Afghanistan dominated the news cycle, Leslie became inspired by the civilians caught up in the war. ""I was fascinated by telling the stories of people from other cultures, the stories of people affected by the war, not so much the war itself. I always wanted to make a difference for people and to be their voice ‚Å† and photojournalism did that for me."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63c98b30edfc265ff0a487ac_Peruv.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > A still from Leslie's  <a href=""https://lesliespurlock.com/travel/"" >Peruvian Amazon</a>  collection. </figcaption></figure> Her professional aspirations would have to wait, however. Leslie prioritised her family life coming out of school, which left little time for her photography. It was not until her children were 12, 6, and 4, that she felt that things were stable enough for her to finally follow her calling.  Her first experience as a photojournalist came in the early 2000s, when she decided to pursue documentary work in Haiti. After an astounding false start ‚Å† the organisation that she was getting ready to cover turned out to be illegitimate, and quite scandalous ‚Å† she instead found work with a different nonprofit on the island. It ended up being a transformative project, and Leslie continued to travel back to Haiti in the following years.   ""I always wanted to make a difference for people.""    Leslie Spurlock   On her very next trip to the island, Leslie spent three weeks embedded with rebel insurgents who ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in a coup d'etat. Over subsequent trips, she witnessed gun battles, skirmishes, and a deadly flood. After surviving two separate attempts on her life, having fallen afoul of both sides of the conflict, Leslie cut short what she knew then would be her final trip.  While Leslie would have loved to continue her career as a photojournalist, the harsh economic realities of the profession made that difficult.""I go on spec when I go, so I have to finance everything,"" she explains.""When I get published I have an agent that I split everything 50/50 with, and major outlets only pay $5 for an image nowadays. You have to do other things to make money unless you're a huge name."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63c987d3db4672cef9a9716f_Bad%20Ass%20Female.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://foundation.app/@lesliespurlock/protests/8"" > Bad Ass Female </a> , from the  2020: A Year of Protests  collection. This photograph shows one of the few female members of the NFAC who marched in Louisville, Kentucky, for Breonna Taylor. </figcaption></figure> Compounding this was the fact that Leslie got divorced a few years following her first trip to Haiti; something that she partly attributes to a lack of understanding of her challenging career. No longer able to support herself on a photojournalist's income, Leslie took the job that many photographers do to make ends meet: shooting weddings.  She found that sharp change of pace largely unfulfilling. And though she was able to flex some creative muscles doing portraits ‚Å† and get her adrenaline fix by storm-chasing ‚Å†, she longed to return to the kind of work that she had done in Haiti. After 14 years of shooting weddings, she made the conscious decision to stop on January 1st 2020: a wise choice in hindsight, to say the least.   ""The biggest thing for me is that I want to tell the truth.""    Leslie Spurlock   When protests broke out across the United States in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder in May 2020, Leslie felt called into action once again.""I went to the protests that first week in Minneapolis after it happened. I was actually just going there for me, to cover it for my own sake. I never expected to do anything with the images at all,"" she recalls.  After a friend urged Leslie to publish the photos, she got back in touch with her agency. In total, she and her husband covered 17 protests across the United States.""I've always wanted to capture emotion and be there to cover history,"" she says.""But the biggest thing for me is that I want to tell the truth about what is happening, and try to make the world open their eyes and care about other people for once."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63c98872914b3440cf348b6a_Burn%20it%20down.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://foundation.app/@lesliespurlock/protest/4"" > Burn It Down </a> , photographed Leslie Spurlock. This image depicts one of the fires that Lesie and her husband came across when arriving in the 5th Precinct in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 29 2020. </figcaption></figure> 2020 saw Leslie find her way back to her passion after a decade and a half. Unfortunately, the financial situation for photojournalists had not improved in that time. Despite having her images from the protests published all over the world, Leslie never got much in the way of compensation. In that way, Leslie's career arc lends itself perfectly to the discovery she would make, just over a year after she returned to photojournalism.  She discovered NFTs around August 2021 and admittedly, did not get it at first.""It made no sense to me at all. I didn't understand how this related to photography, because it was all PFPs, so I put it off for a while.""  Nevertheless, NFTs continued to appear on her timeline. Eventually, Leslie had seen enough to believe that this was where the art world was headed, and she was certainly not planning on getting left behind. After spending some time educating herself in this new sphere, she set about building a community in November 2021 and, by December 2nd, she had minted her first ever NFT on Foundation.  NFTs presented the solution to the problem that Leslie had been running into for years. Finally, she could do exactly the work that she wanted to, and sell it to people without having to acquiesce to the unfair terms set forth by legacy media outlets. NFTs have also allowed her to support her subjects in various ways that she could not before: while she still endeavours to leave as little trace as possible on the situations that she photographs, she is now able to make donations to the organisations that her subjects are part of, or help in other ways.  The greatest gift that NFTs gave Leslie, however, was the ability to reframe how she looked at her own work. Now that she had experienced the joy of connecting with collectors and admirers of her work, she was able to truly appreciate it for herself.""NFTs made me look at my work differently"", she explains.""They made me realise that my work is something that should be displayed in galleries and should be considered as art. I never dreamed that people would want to own my work, so it opened my eyes to a whole new world. And it was pretty incredible.""  Leslie notes that it has taken photojournalists slightly longer to come around to the world of NFTs than artists in other disciplines; in part, because many of the most iconic photojournalists in the world do not own their work, but rather, the agencies that contract them do. In any case, Leslie is thrilled to see more and more photojournalists entering the industry.  If and when they do, there are certainly a few models to follow. One such model would see more photographers shoot on spec and retain ownership of their images, thus allowing them to license their photos to outlets and brands, while holding on to the ability to sell them down the road. At least, that is what has been working for Leslie‚Ä¶ to an extent.""It's been a little bit easier since I discovered that I could actually make some money through NFTs."" She adds, laughing,""Now granted, I'm a collector and I spent all my money on other artists, so I still have nothing, but it does help some!"" ",2514
LimeWire's new mission to bring music collectibles to millions,limewires onboarding mission,Fri Jul 08 2022 15:53:02,"Under new ownership, LimeWire is reinventing itself as an music NFT marketplace. A deal with Universal Music, fiat payments, and innovative ways to engage means that LimeWire could become the NBA Top Shot of music.",Fri Jul 08 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Music; Marketplaces; Limewire; Platforms,Clovis McEvoy," LimeWire's rebirth as an NFT marketplace has officially begun. Launching with a focus on music collectibles, the company has rolled out an exclusive selection of content from artists including Travis Barker, BRandy Ginsburg, Nicky Jam, and a host of other musicians.  But what's more intriguing than the big-name artists launching with LimeWire is how the iconic music platform of the noughties is tackling the central question of web3's nascent music sector  "" how to grow the listener and collector base from a small community of tech-savvy early adopters into a cultural category all of its own.  It starts with payment options. LimeWire has a stated focus on lowering the financial barrier of entry for fans, and to that end their NFT marketplace has been built on Algorand. The blockchain has been at the leading edge of interoperability with its co-chain architecture and state proofs, meaning that LimeWire will find it much easier to build multi-chain accessibility into their ecosystem from the start.  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:4922px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""4922px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62c85110cebe6652b921c856_LimeWire_CEOs_Paul%20and%20Julian%20Zehetmayr_CCO_Ivis%20Buric_COO%20Marcus%20Feistl.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Under new ownership: LimeWire's leadership team from right to left (Ivis Buris (Chief Communications Officer), Paul and Julian Zehetmayr (co-CEOs), and Marcus Feistl (Chief Operating Officer)). </figcaption></figure> However, it doesn't end there. LimeWire's vision for NFT music collectibles is powered by fiat payments, including credit card and bank transfers. LimeWire's Chief Communications Officer, Ivis Buric, told Culture3 that""current NFT marketplaces are too cumbersome, time consuming, and have too many barriers to entry."" In her view, forcing fans to use a wallet and purchase cryptocurrencies before they can connect with their favourite artist is a bottleneck that needs to be removed for the community to expand.""With LimeWire,"" says Buric.""You can use any type of currency, crypto or fiat, to buy and sell NFTs.""  Then, of course, there's the actual content that LimeWire is offering. Users of the original P2P platform will remember that it hosted all kinds of media, but this time around the platform is taking a different angle. Buric says that LimeWire's decision to focus purely on music NFTs  "" and related artworks, IRL experiences, and physical content  "" taps into an already established culture around collecting memorabilia and exclusives, thus making it an ideal on-ramp to web3.""We think that NFTs are something that really resonates with music fans who are accustomed to collecting music and merch from the artist they love,"" she adds.  Notwithstanding the many original and creative web3-native musicians already working in the space, we'll know that web3 is going mainstream when big label artists begin appearing on the scene. That's why LimeWire's deal to license content from the world's largest music label, Universal Music Group, generated so much attention. Rather than supplant the old guard, LimeWire's approach has been to augment them, helping guide web2's industry giants into this new space.   Co-CEOs Paul and Julian Zehetmayr see a huge opportunity in music.""We see a huge demand in the entertainment space for platforms that recognise and appreciate artists for their talent and put them in the driver's seat."" The Austrian-born brothers argue that their high-profile deal with UMG represents""a true demonstration of the pace at which the music industry is embracing web3."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:40%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""40%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62c851af67a4fd7e7af00a68_BRandy Ginsburg.JPG"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >BRandy Ginsburg, the American singer, songwriter, and actress</figcaption></figure> With some of the planet's most famous musicians under the UMG umbrella, LimeWire is well-positioned to leverage this relationship and bring established web2 fandoms into NFTs. The platform's launch takes a step in this direction, focusing on diverse set of web2 musicians spanning rock, reggae, EDM, R&amp;B, hip-hop, and world music. The content these artists are offering comes across as carefully curated, spanning digital art, exclusive music, in-studio or backstage footage, in-person experiences, and even physical objects (in the form of Travis Barker's actual drum kit).  This blend of digital and non-digital content is yet another piece of the onboarding puzzle  "" there are some collectors who will understand and appreciate the adventurousness of BRandy Ginsburg's flower bouquet NFT and spoken word poetry, whilst others will come for the simple pleasures of an exclusive EP from Dillon Francis. Speaking to Culture3, Travis Barker said""LimeWire has created a platform that makes exciting content accessible to all of my fans  "" even ones who are unfamiliar with web3.""  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:50%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""50%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62c853817273c2710227f158_Travis%20Barker%20smaller.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >Travis Barker is dropping his first ever NFT collection on LimeWire.</figcaption></figure> In much the same way that NBA Top Shot brought legions of sporting fans to NFTs by harnessing the familiarity of trading cards, music can forge a similar path using a similar, accessible approach. As new and traditional buying habits become ever more entwined, we're likely to reach a place where music fans are collecting merch and experiences just as they always have, perhaps even without the awareness that the item they purchased is technically an NFT. The platform's strategy to combine web3 with the best musicians in the world is clear from its list of investors, which includes deadmau5 and Crypto.com.  LimeWire is far from the only company foregrounding the familiar whilst innovating away much of web3's gritty functionality. But in terms of strategy, LimeWire stands out for its clarity and breadth. The reborn platform is poised to have a significant impact: major label artists with web2-level name recognition, established memorabilia paradigms coupled with new and exciting options, and, crucially, financial entry points that feel frictionless and safe. This is the recipe for mainstream adoption. ",1945

That and Harry, Truff's Bored Ape.""I can't change my name, and I can't change Harry. Harry is forever me and I'm forever Harry."" That quote in itself speaks volumes about the role that NFTs and cryptoart plays in Truff's life today. A trader in the space turned art collector who entered the web3 world in 2020, Truffington has seen all sides of the NFT market, from before the pandemic bull run to the current bear market. And as a TradFi alum, Truff has seen plenty of both. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:50%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""50%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62af475514eedef97207a2a1_Harry%20(8526).png"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" > <figcaption > Harry, Lord Truffington's Bored Ape (#8526). </figcaption></figure>""Last year there were so many PFP projects, collectibles, that were launched every day.

And at the end of the day, JPEGs are just another asset class.""Whatever you trade, the psychology of people in the market are the same, regardless of what their market is. I would buy as I see something starting to get hyped and I would sell when I thought the hype had already had a big run up  it doesn't matter if it continues to go up, as long as you can lock in some profits. ""Up to April, last year, there was a lot of hype in everything that came out on Nifty Gateway. You could assess based on the trading for the artists' other pieces roughly where that thing could trade. The idea was to always price it in the primary market a little bit below what it would sell for in the secondary, to create profits for more people, attract more people to the platform, and overall, it is always good when an artist sells for X, and then the next day the price is 2X.""   ""Harry is forever me and I'm forever Harry.""    Lord Truffington   So how did Truff meet Harry? Or perhaps a better word is become'.""I think Bored Apes at some point will be a case study of the very early emergence of NFTs within the media and mainstream culture. I don't think that the Bored Apes actually did something different. I think it is just that the people that bought it started to embrace these JPEGs in a way that made them feel proud to have it. They were showing it all the time and they were wanting to connect with other people who had that ape.""  It was the community aspect of the Bored Ape Yacht Club that made it so exciting and so big.""CryptoPunks were the real, true OG collectibles; but they've not had that. The community is very different. One thing that Apes did very well is that they were the first real collection that gave full commercial rights to their holders. We have seen a lot of people developing brands or developing products in the real world. We have seen brands buying apes and associating themselves with the community. This created a snowball effect where we got periods in which celebrities started buying apes and using them as a PFP, which is incredible."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1046px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1046px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6401df75051244d2629df949_Screenshot%202023-03-03%20at%2011.51.50.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x2953399124f0cbb46d2cbacd8a89cf0599974963/93281785975417662181072555544922004567407315035659333894901814482531357032648"" > WAGMI </a> , by Soul Curry Art. </figcaption></figure> As the market rumbled on and the capital continued to build up, Truff began to explore the world of art for its own sake.""As I started to build a bit of liquidity, I got a lot more into art, 1/1s, and some editions. Less collectibles and more really nice stuff that I like to look at and admire"". Indeed, though reluctant to call himself a curator' ""I think that's a loaded word and I don't know enough about art, in general""  Lord Truffington spends almost all of his time on the collecting side of NFTs these days, rather than the flipping. ""There is a spectrum when you buy a piece of art,"" he explains.""On one end, you have the investment purchases, regardless of what the piece looks like. On the opposite end, you have the art that you just buy because you fall in love with it, the pieces where you don't care what happens to the price."" As a collector, Truff is a huge fan of <a href=""https://twitter.com/soulcurryart"">Ishita Banerjee</a>, known as Soul Curry Art, and he has some of her prints hung up behind him on our interview.  ""I love everything that she puts out. One difference between the traditional art world and NFTs is that the community is not as large in NFTs. You actually get to connect with the person behind the artwork. You get to talk to them and learn a little bit more about their history, their story, and the story that they're trying to convey in the piece.""  Truff himself enjoys artwork inspired by vivid colours and composed of abstract shapes.""Art is about the emotions, the feeling that a particular piece can arise in you. You might just see something and fall in love with the colours, the shapes, or the underlying meaning that the artist is putting into that piece."" His On Cyber galleries are full of abstract  almost neo-Cubist  and vibrant pieces, but his Twitter timeline is an eclectic collection of all kinds of creations, on Tezos and Ethereum, like Prismatic Selva, a tropical floral piece by <a href=""https://objkt.com/profile/tz1dgQKDJaYuuik8orMteNzxq9LJSdSuMGZN/created"">Maneki Neko</a>. ""I spend most of my day curating on Twitter, which is good and bad at the same time! I have a tweet that I do twice a day called Truff's Truffles, where I showcase art that I like: one tweet is about photography, the other is about digital art. I try to build a little bit of community, to get as many collectors, as many people as possible within the community, interested in buying art.""  Community is the""backbone of everything that is happening here in web3,"" regardless of whether it is small groups of collectors and artists, or the wider movement.""If you think about what web3 really means, it's where people log in with their wallets and have some tokens that give them some rights or maybe even some part of ownership. It automatically generates a different type of engagement from the end user. Rather than just being a consumer of that platform or that content, they become a lot more engaged, and they tend to congregate together  because we are social animals, right? It creates something that before just was not possible. You don't say oh, I am part of the eBay community, because I'm a user of eBay'.""   ""Community is a fundamental pillar of this new web3 world.""    Lord Truffington   But in addition to feeling connected to their PFP and their DAOs and dApps, everyone across the web3 space feels a certain affinity, in an us against the world' sense, as part of the wider movement.""If you take crypto Twitter or NFT Twitter, it's an incredible community. The love and the support in the community, whether the markets are doing well, or whether the market is like right now, currently we're kind of in a bear market  that's probably an understatement, we definitely are in a bear market  but the amount of support that people are giving each other on Twitter; it's fantastic. That has created broader communities, like NFT Twitter, and these smaller communities: the pieces that you own, the collectors that you collect with, the people that you talk with. It's something that the traditional art world is struggling to understand. Community is a fundamental pillar of this new web3 world and of NFTs as well.""  For his own part, Truff's next project is <a href=""https://nftcollectors.wiki/"">nftcollector.wiki</a>, a collector database built to help artists find collectors in the messy NFT ecosystem.""I like to help artists that are coming to the market, trying to give them a bit more guidance into how to do NFTs, how to price it, how to do editions, how to launch it. And I also collect: I buy a lot of art NFTs that I will probably keep for a long time."" The next step is to help artists find collectors directly. In the traditional art world, marketing art is handled by galleries, who take a 50% cut. In the decentralised art world, that marketing falls on the shoulders of the artist, who would prefer to spend their time making art, rather than promoting it. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1036px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1036px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6401e308470c4e0fc609dbd7_Screenshot%202023-03-03%20at%2012.05.25.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/93281785975417662181072555544922004567407315035659333894901814610074705854469"" > Transparent </a> , by Soul Curry Art. </figcaption></figure>""Often artists ask me for advice or help, and the starting point that I use in most cases is that your art is your product and it needs to be marketed."" But, as Truff explains, unless you spend your life on Twitter and you talk to a lot of people, this is hard.""So I started, a few weeks ago, to work on a vision to create an art discovery tool that will make this process of discovering art to fall in love with a bit easier."" The site launched in May 2022 as a free resource to collect the largest collectors in art NFTs.""You can go and see what these collectors collect, follow them on Twitter  which I would always recommend  and see their OpenSea gallery."" ""For artists it is incredibly difficult to create their own audience, reach a wide audience, and create their own collector space. The idea is to create an art discovery tool that is helpful for collectors to find art, and a way for artists to find the right type of collectors."" And for what Lord Truffington is building  in collaboration with <a href=""https://twitter.com/BondiPepe"" >Pepe Bondi</a>  Truff has exactly the same message as for the broader web3 community.""We're putting in the foundations for the next generation of platforms and websites, for the art world and everything else. The market is vOla Kalejayetile, it goes up and down, but we're still building, we are really early, and just stick around, because this is going to go very far."" ",3265
How LTD.INC is bringing ultra-rare physical items onchain ,ltd inc,Mon Dec 12 2022 11:12:33,"NFC chips have become standard practice for connecting physical items to the blockchain. Now LTD.INC is taking the technology a step further, offering collectors unique experiences alongside their physical and digital goods. Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg speaks to LTD.INC CEO Daryl Kelly about what blockchain means for the future of consumer culture.",Wed Dec 14 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Fashion; Luxury; Brands; Applications,Randy Ginsburg," Like many others, when Daryl Kelly was introduced to Bitcoin in 2016, his first impression was one of scepticism and distrust. But after revisiting the concept a few months later, things finally began to click. A former luxury real estate executive, he soon realised how digital scarcity would transform the future of ownership in both the physical world and across virtual ones. Down the rabbit hole he went, dedicating the bulk of his waking hours to learning the ins and outs of blockchain technology.  In 2020 he started the Bitcoin Movement, one of the first companies to integrate blockchain technology into a streetwear collection using Near Field Communication (NFC). In its first collaboration with Zuby, the UK rapper, Bitcoin Movement sold 300 hats and t-shirts, each embedded with an NFC chip that, when scanned, connected the physical product to a transaction ID on the blockchain.  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/639a0444547f2e4adc8a19db_QmRiNn6ZGtaN6UCWF8vWHY9WhVUnxzdZLuiesJJHW6JZPk.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://ltd.inc/sicilian-kiss-ltd/6"" > Sicilian Kiss LTD </a> , NFC-infused physical print and digital NFT, by LTD.INC in collaboration with Guido Di Salle. </figcaption></figure> The customer response being promising, Bitcoin Movement's proof of concept helped Daryl realise that the potential for blockchain-powered products extended far beyond Bitcoin. With that, LTD.INC was born, partnering with top-tier creators, brands, and artists to create physical and digital NFT experiences. From fine art prints to couture denim, each physical product contains an embedded NFC chip connected to a unique digital twin recorded immutably on the blockchain, and accessibly presented to consumers via LTD.INC's app.   ""It turned a piece of clothing into a delivery mechanism for music.""     Daryl Kelly   This provides much more than proof of ownership. The true advantage of digitally-native physical fashion is that it opens up new opportunities for brands to engage their customers. It creates a new avenue for deeper, more immersive brand storytelling through exclusive content like artist interviews, unreleased footage, 3D files, and other exclusive opportunities.  Earlier this month, LTD.INC teamed up with web3 musician Ape Rave Club (ARC) to <a href=""https://ltd.inc/ape-rave-club-%22giba-9184%22-hoodie/27"" >release 100 limited edition hoodies</a>, each embedded with an LTD.INC NFC chip. When scanned, the chip reveals an unreleased track from the artist. From that position, Daryl says, there is potentially the opportunity for holders to remix, monetise, and sample their IP. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63970c943b120c949bc19075_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(18).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://ltd.inc/ape-rave-club-%22giba-9184%22-hoodie/2"" > Ape Rave Club ""Giba #9184"" Hoodie </a> , premium hoodie with digital NFT, by LTD.INC in collaboration with Ape Rave Club. </figcaption></figure>""This one was really interesting for us because it turned a piece of clothing into a delivery mechanism for music,"" Daryl recalls. While certain clients handle the physical production in-house, many artists rely on LTD.INC's product development expertise, from conception and IP creation to manufacturing and rollout. To date, LTD.INC has partnered with top brands in web3 and beyond, including a collaboration between the Wrangler Jeans and the NFT collection, Deadfellaz, other web3 artists like Guido Di Salle and PixelMap, one of the oldest NFT collections, as well as mainstream brands and individuals, like the singer Leon Bridges and the late photographer Chi Modu. ""We're really careful about who we collaborate with. We care deeply about crafting really interesting, creative stories, and breaking some rules while doing so,"" he explains with a smile.""All of our partners are aligned in pushing the boundaries with each one of our products. We've got toys, music, art, and fashion, and we push the boundaries in all of them."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/639a02eb371f628c8a864ce5_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(18).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://ltd.inc/mr.-wrangler-icon/15"" > Mr. Wrangler Icon </a> , a digitally animated icon created by LTD.INC in collaboration with Wrangler and Leon Bridges. </figcaption></figure> But there's one""rule"" that LTD.INC refuses to break: mandating creator royalties. Amidst swirling controversy around top marketplaces like OpenSea no longer enforcing creator royalties, LTD.INC is doubling down on the mechanism: each product drop is built with preserving royalties in mind. LTD.INC's smart contracts let artists receive royalties on the secondary sales of their physical prints, a first in the traditional fashion world.   ""We care deeply about crafting really interesting, creative stories.""     Daryl Kelly    And this is only the beginning. As for what's to come, Daryl sees mainstream adoption as an inevitability.  ""In the next five to ten years, kids won't be buying products unless they're scanning them and interacting with them, verifying their authenticity, downloading a digital wearable, and running around with it in their favourite game.""  Today, the state of metaverse experiences is similar to that of mobile phones in the early 2000s, with their antennas and chunky frames.  ""We said it needs to be smaller, quicker, cheaper, and more accessible. The same applies here,"" he says. Innovation follows use, and services like LTD.INC are well on their way.""It will take time for the UX and UI to improve and for the integration of physical products within the metaverse to become more seamless. But it is the next version of the internet."" ",1822
Mad Realities: where engagement beats views,mad realities,Wed Aug 03 2022 13:41:59,Community-led content is the future of storytelling and its natural home is in web3. Mad Realities is at the forefront of this new medium. Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg dives in to see how far they've come and explore if they can make it work.,Thu Aug 04 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Communities-built,Media,Randy Ginsburg," Let's talk media. In traditional web2 media and tech structures, consumers collectively generate ample value for the underlying network and platform, both in dollars and reach. Simply put, web2 media companies optimise for views. More viewers means more ad revenue and more data, which leads to happier advertisers. Happy advertisers lead to more revenue, which gets re-invested in better algorithms and better content, leading to more clicks and accelerating the revenue flywheel.  But with traditional TV and cable networks' ratings plummeting, and streaming services losing eyeballs to social media competitors, it's abundantly clear that the mainstream media is losing the competition for consumers' attention. They are finally recognising its fundamental flaw: viewers are creating value for the networks while receiving nothing, aside from entertainment, in return.  Enter Web3 media. Whereas traditional web2 content is geared towards pleasing advertisers, web3-native content is catered  to  the viewers because it's created and owned  by  the viewers themselves. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6343f57ae8067d013a44c2b6_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(3).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Communities held together by NFTs enable a digital-native alternative to traditional studio productions that is focused on content which emphasises engagement over clicks. </figcaption></figure> Through NFTs that enable  community-led content , Web3 media projects like Mad Realities enhance the viewer experience in completely new ways. Not only do they provide audiences with unparalleled access, but they allow fans to participate in the financial upside of the show's success and play a role in creating the storyline themselves. By involving user communities more deeply in the content and storytelling that they consume, web3 media firms are positioning themselves on a far broader industry trend, but doing in a way that can only be done via blockchain.  What is Mad Realities and how does it work?   A brainchild of two New York twenty-somethings, Devin Lewtan and Alice Ma, Mad Realities is a decentralised media platform focused on shared experiences, co-creation, and community-ownership. Their first show,  Proof of Love , is a community-directed dating show, is Mad Realities' first attempt at bringing this vision to life.  On the face of it,  Proof of Love  is similar to many reality TV dating shows: Each week a new bachelor or bachelorette will choose between four desperately single contestants for a shot at love. But to turn Mad Realities into their own mad reality, Ma and Lewtan needed funding. The pair formed a DAO and turned to NFTs, successfully crowdfunding over 172 ETH (around ¬£420k / $500k at the time) through the sale of Genesis Passes. They subsequently raised ¬£5 million ($6m) in a seed round led by Paradigm Ventures.  The Mad Realities ecosystem is built around the Genesis Pass. These animated-rose NFTs granted holders governance rights such as the ability to vote on cast members, save and eliminate contestants, and determine what happens on dates each week, along with access to live community events. Holders of the rarer Passes also gained access to host an episode (if they choose), select pick-up lines for contestants, and have a say in the set design. In addition to the membership passes, Mad Realities auctions off a 1/1 NFT prior to the start of each episode which gives the winning bidder a producer credit and sponsorship rights. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:812px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""812px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6343f658f4b9136ebe8eca6a_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(3).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Mad Realities let token holders vote on the cast for their first show, a dating reality production called Proof of Love. </figcaption></figure> In March 2022, with a community over 1,000 strong, Mad Realities Season 0 launched to the masses. For six weeks, Sunday nights became Mad Realities nights. The free-flowing, unscripted episodes were live-streamed for free on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjane-NIEN4bIrCGpVUM-Q"">YouTube</a>, while Genesis Membership Pass holders gathered for exclusive members-only watch parties at the Bright Moments Gallery in SoHo in New York. By early May, the show garnered enough attention to sell out the 800-seat Webster Hall in New York's East Village for the season finale.  Prior to Mad Realities, co-founder Devin Lewtan was one of the key minds behind  NYU Girls Roasting Tech Guys , a viral Clubhouse show born from the loneliness of the pandemic. A few times a week, during the depths of lockdown and the short-lasting hype of the audio-only social media app, the makeshift dating show allowed strangers to come up""on stage"" and""shoot their shot"" to attract a date. Oftentimes, the contestants would be critiqued by Lewtan and her friends. The show was filled with hilarious unscripted and spontaneous moments. It's this same raw, unscripted, and unfiltered comedy that has made Mad Realities so enjoyable for the community.  Why Mad Realities can be the future of (web3) media   Although the Web3 media industry is still nascent, its potential cannot be ignored. Not only does crowdfunding through NFTs lower the barrier to entry for creatives and storytellers, but it also unlocks new financial incentive structures for both creators and audiences alike. By building a community of people who care about the content nearly as much as the creators themselves, media companies can build a funding vehicle driven entirely by fans, while also delivering value back to these audiences in return.  This flywheel comes from the tighter incentives alignment for creators and fans, the latter being far more incentivised for a show or its creators to succeed compared to web2 productions that lack a form of community ownership. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2731px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2731px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ebf63b5badaf07ee4d1d51_mrhall.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Mad Realities sold out the 800-seat Webster Hall in New York for its season finale in May. </figcaption></figure> Both creators and their community share the desire to increase the price of their NFTs, and with Genesis Passes limited to 548 editions, the only way that's done is by increasing the value of being a member of the community. This incentivises creators to engage token holders with extensive influence over the show's direction and deliver a high-quality product, whilst the holders themselves are incentivised to act as responsible stewards and advocates of the programme. As the floor price of the Genesis collection rises, tracking the popularity of the show, we should expect the creators to release more accessible ways to engage with the show to broaden the community, better refine the product, and reward early adopters.  If Mad Realities executes successfully, they could be the first to define a new paradigm: where media platforms are no longer rewarded for reaching the largest audiences, but rather the most engaged ones. Success will be measured in mutually created value, viewers themselves become an alternative to traditional studios, and the trend of user-generated content progresses to an ever larger scope, and indeed, even a mad reality.

"""Artists and creators are the beating heart of the NFT space""  in conversation with Mando and OSF",mando and osf,Sat Jun 18 2022 18:30:58,"Mando and OSF have gone from ordinary collectors to community builders noticed by the likes of Snoop Dogg.

Ovie Faruq (OSF) and Mike Anderson (Mando), two former derivatives traders, are the founders of Degenz, an NFT resources group helping market participants understand the space. In under 18 months, they've gone from ordinary NFT collectors to operating one of the fastest-growing communities in the space  "" and attracting the attention of Snoop Dogg, Cozomo Medici, and Raoul Pal.   This level of execution and success does not happen by accident. They speak to Signal about the secrets to their success, what happened to the 150 Bored Apes they minted, and what they think is missing from the NFT space.  ç  Signal:  What is Degenz, and why did you create it?  Ovie Faruq:  Degenz launched in July 2021 as a profile picture comic collection. Ultimately, it failed because we did not have the experience to build comic IP. The Degenz ecosystem ended 2021 with a floor price of zero and coming into 2022, we felt an acute sense of responsibility to change Degenz into something new. We knew our strengths were in trading, so we started an NFT resources group with daily market updates, commentary, Q&amp;A, and long-form deep-dive reports. The resources were positively received, and since January, we've seen our Discord and Twitter organically grow by 4x.  ç Signal:  You both had successful jobs at top-tier investment banks and didn't hate your time there; why did you leave to go full-time into NFTs?  Mike Anderson:  I started collecting in early 2021, and Ovie got involved about one month later. Over 2021 we saw that the opportunity set in web3 was rapidly growing from a collector and entrepreneurial standpoint. There was a global movement towards NFTs and the metaverse; if we didn't join, we would live to regret it.  Being a trader is a strange role. It's playing a video game against other people, but you don't acquire the skills to start a business. Yes, you are good with numbers, but after 10-20 years, it is easy to get stuck in a job. We identified many parallels between financial and NFT trading and realised we were uniquely positioned to offer something different that was lacking in the space.    ""Artists and creators are the beating heart of the NFT space.""    Mike Anderson (Mando)    Signal:  What have been some of your biggest wins and losses as collectors and investors?

At what point did you decide you wanted to contribute as a digital artist?  Ovie:  When I was 13-18 years old, I spent a lot of time online, and digital art became a hobby until I went to university. When I joined the NFT space and saw the quality of everyone's work, I thought I wouldn't be able to sell anything. One day, I was bored at work, drew something , and minted it. It sold for 0.5eth.

We thought the collection would settle at 0.4-0.5eth, but it catapulted in price and volume after Snoop bought. It was a complete surprise, as we have no connection to Snoop.

If a piece becomes popular, I could do a series, update the art, make it different and give more people the opportunity to own it. Can it ever match the original? I don't think it can, but you can create sequels and editions and increase the community aspect.  Signal:  Recently, Damien Hirst offered holders of  The Currency  an opportunity to do a private tour at his studio. Ovie, how are you planning to leverage the relationship between artist and collector now that you can identify your holders via wallet address?  Ovie:  If someone buys one of my pieces, they access a token gated Discord. It's lively in there, lots of chat, and I know all my collectors by name. I want to do an event this year or next year and make that token gated. I can offer free editions to my holders, gamify the mechanics, and do exciting things using wallet snapshots.

Mike:  Yes, I started in 2020, but I found that my experience of collecting traditional art made me a worse digital art collector. The skills I learned looking at traditional art are very different from 1/1 digital art. For example, history is viewed differently. First on-chain art is a big deal; early pieces are important, and so is rarity. People are looking for web3 native pieces, GIFs that reflect the culture of the space. So yes, collecting traditional art helped me in that I was comfortable spending money on art, but it didn't necessarily help me find the right choices at the outset.  ç  Signal:  Who are some of the people you would like to highlight or think are talented artists?  ç Ovie:  OG artists like Coldie and XCopy set the example of driving value to collectors, not getting sucked into the hype cycle, and are choosing to play the long game. They set the standard, and I'd like to thank them for leading the space.  Mike:  Artists and photographers have had a tough twelve months. Collectibles have been successful, but the sales of 1/1 art have slowed. The space needs curation, not from one individual but a structural layer that can improve the space. Currently, artists and photographers like Misan Harriman and Alien Queen are not getting the exposure they deserve. Artists and creators are the beating heart of the NFT space.  Signal:  Ovie, what would be your advice to new artists entering this space?  Ovie:  Artists need to understand it is a different market. Yes, the art matters, but collectors who invest want the value of the art to increase. Artists can capture a broader market, but they need to find ways to differentiate themselves. Otherwise, it is difficult to elevate your work above established artists."" When we look back, Ovie and Mike are examples of artists and builders who will be regarded as stewards of the space over the long term. Whether their art is their legacy or their ability to be educators, the space is better off with their contribution.  ",2786

Manouschka Guerrier has lived many professional lives. Having missed the boat to web2, she speaks to Ola Kalejaye Kalejaye about why she's diving deep into web3 and how she found her niche.",Wed Nov 09 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Communities-built,Nft; Usa; North-America,Ola Kalejaye," One might expect that someone who cut their teeth as a TV food personality who later worked as a celebrity chef, Manouschka Guerrier must have carried some lifelong passion for cooking. That couldn't be further from the case. ""If you ask my family, they're completely shocked. I tried to make Chinese fried rice once and my brother likes to tell everybody that it was the grossest thing he ever had in his life!"" The path that saw Manouschka become a renowned in the food industry started with a mild case of homesickness. Pursuing an acting career in 1990s Los Angeles with no Haitian restaurants, she called on her grandmother to share some of her favorite recipes from home.  ""Through that process, I discovered that I have a super palate. I go somewhere and I can identify all the ingredients in the dish. I realised, okay, I can start cooking more'. After a while, it became my therapy. There's something about making from scratch, feeding people, and them enjoying it. I loved the way that made me feel.""  It was her blog  Single Serving  that landed Manouschka her role on  The Private Chefs of Beverly Hills . The show itself was not a good experience  """"I did not think that Black women in reality TV were portrayed very well,"" she says  "" but it did lead to the high-profile gigs that followed, with periods spent as a private chef for the likes of Drake, Selena Gomez, and Ariana Grande. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:808px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""808px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/636c06dc15b52207b086c707_kM3_MBnD-(1)-transformed.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption><em>Manouschka's career took off as a TV chef, which led to work with Hollywood A-listers like Drake and Arianna Grande. </figcaption></figure> Despite the importance of her blog in the early days, her growing work with private clients prevented Manouschka from diving further into being a content creator just as the web2 social media wave began to encroach upon her business.""Not only did the pandemic decimate my industry, but so did social media, because TikTok chefs and Instagram chefs are willing to do my work for little to no money to be able to say that they worked for this client or that client.""  As 2020 marked a paradigm shift in her industry, Manouschka suddenly found herself with more time on her hands. She decided to spend part of it learning more about that""magic internet money"" her niece had first told her about back in 2015.""Now I had the time to learn about it, and while I'm learning, I stumbled into NFT spaces on Clubhouse. At first, I was of course judging it like I judged Vine and Instagram and everything else. But I gave it a shot and I absolutely fell in love with it.""  After finding success as a creator on television, she had missed the move to social media. Manouschka is ensuring that she is at the forefront of the internet's new shift to creator communities enabled by web3.""From then, it just seemed to me that it was important to really focus on being a part of building web3, because I missed the boat on web2, and I saw what that did.""  When her introduction to Web3 finally came, it was hardly a major ask for the ever-flexible Manouschka to shift her attention once more.""I think this is probably my sixth career, but web3 really fits my wheelhouse because I love connecting people, I love art, artistry, and artists. And I love the possibility that people of colour have more opportunities available here than ever before because we're studying what's going to happen. I thought, let me just put the pots and pans down for a little bit and learn about this'.""  While the passion to get involved in Web3 was there, how she could best participate was not immediately obvious. Of course, there was a thought to experiment with NFTs, but for a creator whose artform centers on taste and smell, digital art was not an easy pivot to execute. Nonetheless, she continued showing up and making connections. Before long, her role as a facilitator and connector revealed its merits. ""I saw that artists were not really good at selling themselves and talking about their story, when it was really artists' stories that were selling. But I've always championed people, so it evolved into that. I would speak up on behalf of artists. I really got to meet and understand a lot of people in the space. So it was easy for me to connect people.""   ""I started educating people on how to have an IRL event.""    Manouschka Guerrier   It speaks to the energy and excitement that spread throughout the industry over the past couple of years that Manouschka was so inspired to participate that her network turned into professional opportunities.

There's no food here, we have to buy our own drinks, and wait, now you want us to buy merch? I could have sold this damn NFT for $30,000 and this is how you treat me?

It was in Harlem, in 1958, where 57 jazz pioneers, from Thelonious Monk to Dizzy Gillespie, met at a brownstone to record their role in elevating jazz through a photograph shot by Art Kane for Esquire magazine. Forty years later, 177 hip-hop artists met on the same spot for a shot published by XXL magazine to mark the Black community's continued contributions to contemporary culture.   ""It was the morale boost that my people needed.""    Manouschka Guerrier   Shot by Gordon Parks, it is one of many homages inspired by the 1958 photograph, known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Great_Day_in_Harlem_(photograph)"" >A Great Day in Harlem</a>, but was the only one that was held at the same spot. Manouschka was determined to celebrate today's pioneering Black crypto artists in the same way. ""At the time that [hip-hop] photo was taken, you're looking at people like, like Eric B and Rakim, and Mos Def  "" they weren't huge stars, they were just scratching on the surface, which I feel like we're doing now with web3.""  Manouschka reached out to Keith Grossman, President at TIME Magazine and an active thought leader in web3, to make it happen.""He actually declined because he felt that Esquire should do it, since they did it before [in 1958]. I said Well, no, because XXL did it for hip-hop, and I don't see Esquire hosting rooms every day, I see you."" ""I wasn't going to take a 'no'. It was bigger than me. It was something that was really, really important. It was the morale boost that my people needed."" After lobbying other members of the TIME team, Grossman eventually changed his mind, supporting Manouschka in organising <a href=""https://time.com/6194057/harlem-nft-artists-hip-hop-jazz/"" >an event that welcomed around 100 people</a>. Brandon <a href=""https://twitter.com/RUFF_DRAFT"" > ""Ruff Draft""</a> Ruffin had the honour of photographing the 89 attendees, including some of the icons from the 1998 hip-hop shoot.  Above all else, Manouschka and her peers see the potential of the blockchain as a long-needed equaliser for artists who have historically had less access to the resources that are instrumental to a sustainable career. Beyond that, the  Web3 Day in Harlem  photo speaks to how the ambitions of the Black Web3 community are even further reaching than those of their predecessors, certainly when it comes to intra-community equity and representation. ""The difference between the jazz photo and the hip-hop photo, [compared to] the Web3 photo, was how many Black women were in it. It was predominantly Black women. We're finally in a space where Black women are being heard. We have a lot more resources than ever before. Web3 is the platform that we've been waiting for."" ",2740
"Why Game of Thrones, Disney, and Marvel illustrator Marc Simonetti is adding NFTs to his portfolio",marc simonetti,Wed Aug 17 2022 23:19:45,"Best known for drawing Game of Thrones' Iron Throne, Marc Simonetti is an exceptionally diverse concept artist, with Aladdin, Aquaman, and Transformers amongst the classics on his resume. Yet it is in web3 where Marc has found the freedom to fully explore his creativity. He speaks to Steph Kunkel Kunkel about creating magical worlds that we have never seen before.",Thu Aug 18 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Digital-Art; Animation,Steph Kunkel," Growing up, Marc Simonetti describes himself as""the kid that was always drawing."" He originally studied as an engineer, but decided to apply this perspective in the arts world, studying at the Emile Cohl School in Lyon, named after Emile Cohl, father of animated cartoon. Marc quickly established himself as a concept artist, working on visual effects and illustration for studios like Marvel and Disney, novels like  Game of Thrones  (he drew the original Iron Throne for George RR Martin), and even artwork for video games and theme parks.  While working full-time on films, Marc saw his friends succeeding in the web3 space and was naturally very curious, thinking that it could provide him with fresh air and the freedom to further expand his skillset. Upon entering web3 in 2020, Marc has since developed his fine art practice, merging traditional art, music, animation, and storytelling techniques to produce thought-provoking questions about the world we live in, through his artwork.   Marc changed his philosophy on art after hearing a quotation from his friend, Sylvain Desprez,""If it's a commission, you're not a true artist"". He now defines his Commissioned art' as art that he is paid for, and his web3 and NFT work as his Fine Art.' This distinction emphasises Marc's perspective on what it means to be an artist and creates a division between these concepts. Marc says""you can't compare fine art progression to a normal or commissioned job,"" as he believes that the two should be viewed and treated separately.  For a traditional job or commissioned artwork, Marc has to recreate the vision of someone else, instead of following his inspiration wherever it leads him. Web3 and NFTs allow Marc the freedom to explore and do what he loves the most  experiment with crazy perspectives and architectural elements with no restraints , supported by a community built around him and his art, rather than a corporate client. Through his artwork, Marc reacts to the society that we are living in with elegant techniques to share his storytelling and creativity with his audience. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:624px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""624px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62fd2e7ca952c37920272f06_Picture2.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > A frame of  <a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/i-miss-you-36152""> I Miss You </a> . The animation is about the process of memory and how we idolise those who we have lost.""When we're separated from someone, only a fragment of this beloved memory remains, twisted, magnified and echoed, making a beautiful abstract object of the mind."" </figcaption></figure> Marc enjoys his experience with web3, meeting and discovering new people, and the ability to be fully responsible for his own work with no constraints. He is also attracted to the raw energy in the space and how excited everyone is to contribute  it has a huge impact on his professional and artistic work.  <a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/i-miss-you-36152"">I Miss You</a> is inspired by the late Russian-American novelist, Vladimir Nabokov:""I think it is all a matter of love: the more you love a memory, the stronger and stranger it is."" Like most of Marc's work, it embeds his own past in a surrealist experience  when you are stuck in a memory, trying to send a message to a loved one, trying to figure your way through to it. The protagonist in this piece is trying to send a message to someone, though it never arrives.""It's very interesting how memory works, you always seem to remember the same memories,"" Marc says, adding""when we're separated from someone, only a fragment of this beloved memory remains, twisted, magnified and echoed, making a beautiful abstract object of the mind.""  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" style=""max-width:50%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright"" data-rt-max-width=""50%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62fe10138821ee1a306b456a_Tower_of_Babel.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/tower-of-babel-26015""> Tower of Babel </a> , by Marc Simonetti.""This myth questions so many topics: the relationships between humans, the social role of language and the power of a community."" </figcaption></figure> The human experience with memory is almost akin to a one-sided conversation; the person we are remembering, whether alive or passed, has their own experience with this memory, though the events have already happened and are engraved in the past. The moment remains distilled in time  until Marc's artwork breathes animation, vitality, and depth into them, recreating these experiences, and bringing your memories to life again.  Marc's creative process is constantly changing and evolving, shifting to fit the project that he is currently working on. Beyond his surrealist work in NFTs, in a given week, Marc may be working on a cute Disney character, the next superhero for Marvel, or backgrounds for a sci-fi film. He strongly believes""if you only have one creative process, you are trapped in it."" Pouring himself into his artwork, Marc wants viewers to connect with the piece on a meaningful level. His art bridges the gap between the real and fantastical, the darkness and light, and paves a path to human connection.   ""If you only have one creative process, you are trapped in it.""  Marc Simonetti   Although his process changes often, typically Marc sculpts pieces in VR, building it layer by layer.""It's almost like building a sandcastle,"" he says, starting with an empty universe and slowly building and stacking details on top of one another. Inspired by his love for architecture and his engineering background, Marc loves playing with the foregrounds and backgrounds to create visually appealing spaces full of dimensions, depth, and detail. He is transfixed by staircases, cliffs, mountains, and other modes that help you get from one place to another, and simulate movement  he says that this helps him to build worlds based on reality. Marc uses elements and references from the real world that resonate with him to create complex compositions, encompassing small details that invite us to fully immerse ourselves and engage with this new world that he has created. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:6000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""6000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62fe0b5b64228b75c7008a21_aftermath.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/aftermath-33954""> Aftermath </a> , by Marc Simonetti, inspired by the work of Hayao Miyazaki, the Japanese animator, and an image that Marc saw of a tractor pulling a tank in Ukraine. Marc says,""life sometimes has its ways to show complete disrespect to symbols of destruction and turn them into mundane objects to build on."" </figcaption></figure> When he reflects on the purpose of his art, Marc summarises,""I want to leave a positive impact."" He believes art is fundamental for humans and is interested in capturing human nature and cultural influences that reflect society.""Artists have a responsibility to share with the world,"" he says, using artwork as a vessel for others to address societal concerns and disparities. Marc wants the rich and poor, the young and old, anyone from around the world, to confront his artwork and evolve their perspective on life, by giving people the freedom to think about the endless possibilities of the world that we are currently in.  Marc is currently focused on developing a series of strong female characters; his upcoming piece, Boucledor', drops on Nifty Gateway next month. He wants to continue to explore the sentiment and storytelling of family and the idea of trying to find someone along their journey, in the right place, at the right time, at the right moment. ",2333

Most of all, he enjoyed playing sports, especially skateboarding and football  motifs which now appear across his 3D animations. But Marco's flare for creativity did not materialise out of nowhere.  Whilst playing outdoors with his friends, Marco began to make videos, and soon became interested in playing with imagery and composition, as well as experimenting with black and white effects.""I enjoyed making short clips of our adventures,"" he recalls.""In my teen years, I also did some photography.

Marco Mori   When Marco went to Augsburg university to study interactive media design, he found himself having to produce work in 3D.""At first I hated it, as we had to use a super complicated program called Maya. It took ages to produce visually pleasing outputs, so it didn't stimulate me at all."" Nonetheless, Marco developed a taste for the creative output; Maya was not the tool for him, but it was 3D designs that he wanted to create. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:100%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""100%"" data-rt-dimensions=""240:240"" data-page-url=""https://vimeo.com/778818856""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/778818856"" title=""Traces, by Marco Mori""></iframe> </figure> With the knowledge of  what  without the answer of  how , Marco set out on a quest to find the right software to bring his visions to life.

I began with spheres, cube-like shapes, and some landscapes. But I didn't really feel connected to these geometric forms  or static things in general. And so my audience didn't either. I realised that I had to make stuff that was more personal, exuberant, and relatable, to show the viewer what I'm really about."" Laughing, Marco adds,""it turns out that making digital 3D humans was also not that hard  especially if you make them a bit weird on purpose."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:100%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""100%"" data-rt-dimensions=""240:240"" data-page-url=""https://vimeo.com/778817258""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/778817258"" title=""Splash, by Marco Mori""></iframe> </figure> Weird' is the key word for Marco.""I love integrating strange, human-like figures, and things that are generally just odd.

Marco continuously sources inspiration for his creations, absorbing all the minutiae of his day-to-day life.""Talks, music, films, books, you name it. I soak up everything I see, and often bring it back into my work somehow  especially the things that capture my interest because they are somewhat abnormal."" His creations have also been influenced by the motion graphics designers, Esteban Diacono and Antoni Tudisco.""Their work was like nothing I had ever seen before. When I first came across their videos, I was so in awe that I watched most of them about fifteen times  and that is exactly what I want to achieve with my videos as well.""  However, earning a living from his independent creations alone seemed like a distant dream to Marco. After university, he worked creating commissions for clients, developing his own work on the side. That all changed at the end of 2020, when he saw that other 3D designers were selling their private work for significant sums.""I had a whole body of autonomous work ready to be sold.

He recalls the joy that he felt after this creative liberation. Now, Marco earns a living by doing what he enjoys most: making strange, humorous, and often outrageous animations, bound to catch the viewer's attention.   ""I just facilitate a starting point for the imagination.""    Marco Mori  ""My art doesn't really have a special meaning,"" he explains.""I don't come up with a bigger story to surround every piece of work.

It's the biggest win-win situation that you can hope for as an artist."" As with many other 3D designers, web3 gave Marco the opportunity to focus exclusively on his own projects.""I don't make any work for clients anymore. I find it amazing that I can sell my autonomous work as NFTs, and live off that.""  Now that Marco is no longer obliged to work to the deadlines of others, he enjoys taking his time on his work. So far, he is most satisfied with  Aquaria .""It felt so good to not rush this project. For the first time, I reworked the smallest details over and over again to make the result as close to my imagination as possible. I am super happy with the outcome, and better understand the value in not hurrying a process.""  Alongside  Aquaria , Marco's 3D animations have been exhibited on the big screens from Time Square in New York, to Plaza de Callao in Madrid, to Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo. But the best feels like it is yet to come for Marco Mori. ",2346
" ""I hope filmmakers can greenlight themselves with the power of JPEGs""  creating Calladita with Miguel Faus",miguel faus,Fri Dec 02 2022 11:18:10,"The phrase art is the utility' rings more true in film than anywhere else. Miguel Faus is making one of the world's first films funded entirely by NFTs. Barcelona-born, his film Calladita' is an example of how web3 is empowering new voices to tell new stories. He tells Mark Fielding how it's happening.",Thu Dec 01 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Film,Nft-Film-Squad; Calladita; Spain; Europe,Mark Fielding," In April 2021, Miguel Faus demonstrated a commitment to web3 that many allude to, yet few act on, and invested his savings in CryptoPunk #2098. Eighteen months later, the director, writer, and now leader in the vanguard of a swiftly maturing film3 sector, wrapped up filming on  Calladita , the first European film funded entirely by NFTs.   Calladita  is a Spanish-language film that tells the story of Ana, a Colombian maid working for a wealthy family belonging to the Catalan bourgeoisie. It combines independent film ideas with web3, whilst remaining distinct from the existing filmmaking narratives that we are used to today. If this is the evolution of cinema that NFTs promised, directors, producers, and storytellers will be looking to Miguel for inspiration and a roadmap to discover what decentralised movie-making is all about. ""I was an enthusiast, investor, and collector,"" he says, recalling the 2021 NFT bull-run in impeccable English.""But I was focusing all my attention on  Calladita  at that time,"" he adds.""I spent most of my time thinking about how I could bring this film to life. It was natural that the two paths of filmmaking and NFTs would converge at some point."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1024px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1024px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6388d6e2dae5685aaaf5d86a_9sc9YoPOTkGV4v6cO5e6iQbShw-IpKU5AwTX7TUu_ef28jyWpz1EFP7DplXoXB1wC4JZ3WgLWm4bTl5FWTNqL91PflNYZdRWy0j2et5ME8FpzK8KkH7mxB4JtcznHStAjq1iC5eBTLIWgk-Z1NJGqAUmgqj5awAxfoHdvC2lCVtjLrIdjkhiRYGP1X1y.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Miguel Faus (in the background, 4th from left) amidst the crew of Calladita'. </figcaption></figure> On March 2nd 2022, the  Calladita  plan rolled out.""Did it surpass expectations?

He appears to have raised almost 300 eth from around 500 contributors.  ç Calladita  is a satirical, subversive story about female empowerment, racial inequality, and class conflict. But Miguel makes his position clear: he asks the questions, he doesn't supply the answers.""I'm not a message filmmaker. If I had a message, I'd become a preacher or a politician. Films are for asking questions, for questioning reality, for interrogating ourselves and our society.  Calladita  is a question on class dynamics, on what identity and liberty mean in this context, and whether freedom is something internal or external. This is answered by the audience, not by me.""   ""I had no idea if we'd sell three, or sell out.""    Miguel Faus   Is  Calladita  the story that web3 has promised for so long? Miguel Faus is not quite a fringe filmmaker, but he is a relative unknown. And he is the one telling a story that, without web3, might not get told. At least not now, not yet, not with this much expectation and conviction. It's a film funded by cryptocurrency; by CryptoPunks, Nouns, and Bored Apes. But it's also a foreign-language film on class war and freedom. ""There is a lot of freedom in money and social hierarchy. But sometimes that freedom is less important than inner freedom."" I wonder for a moment if he is speaking about the social NFT hierarchy, web3, and what it means to be free as an artist  as a creator.

""If I had a message, I'd become a preacher or a politician.""    Miguel Faus    Calladita  is creating a new narrative for independent filmmakers. It will act as a blueprint going forward.

Did the way  Calladita  get funded change the way it was filmed?""Yes, the validation of five hundred strangers on the internet who believed in my project gave me a feeling of confidence, of satisfaction, a feeling that this movie deserved to be made.""  Filmmakers are watching, web3 is watching, the CryptoPunks are watching, alongside the rest of NFT Twitter. Is Hollywood watching to see what happens next? It is a lot of responsibility for one man to haul around on his shoulders, but Miguel isn't worried. Besides, he wasn't the first to do it.""To me  Keepers of the Inn  was an earlier blueprint.

She was successful in the NFT space as a photographer long before launching  Keepers of the Inn , the NFT collection that funded her eponymous film. By contrast, Miguel is a relatively unknown filmmaker from Spain who used NFTs to make a movie. It was unthinkable three years ago.""I hope  Calladita  can serve as proof that this is possible. I hope filmmakers can greenlight themselves with the power of JPEGs.""  Greenlight themselves with the power of JPEGs. That's the NFT degen speaking. What about the artist, the film philosopher.""In web3, we build in the open. Nothing's been done behind closed doors. Everyone can see our site, our Twitter, our code."" What about Nouns DAO, his second largest backer?""That was done through an on-chain proposal to the DAO. It's a very transparent mechanism that can help future filmmakers go back and investigate everything that we've done. They can take what we did right, and discard what they think they can do better.""  He adds,""thanks to NFTs and the decentralisation of decision-making power, we can start to have more passionate and diverse filmmaking that comes directly from the creators."" Anyone can <a href=""https://nouns.wtf/vote/53"" >check the proposal</a>, see who voted yes', who voted no', and observe that it passed unanimously.  I raise the topic of web3 product placement and NFT easter eggs in  Calladita . Was it always the plan to feature NFT collections and reference crypto culture in the film, or was it something that evolved naturally?""For the past few years I've been surrounded by web3 culture. My movies are personal and that shines through in  Calladita . It felt natural."" Web3 culture plays an important part in the film, whilst crypto plays an important role in the plot. I push for an indication of what that could look like on screen, but Miguel remains coy.""I don't want to reveal too much.""  As well as the NFTs, which are visually represented by film stills, backers of  Calladita  were entitled to an appealing assortment of utility and access: video Q&amp;As with the cast and crew, invites to the set, and even access to the wrap cast and crew party were included. Surprisingly, however, those perks were not fully used up.""Web3 has been great for decentralisation, and most of our holders appreciate the utility, but they don't care about it as much as they do about the film being made."" Is that the real utility? To get films made? To invest in a cultural shift and collect a piece of history? As the  Calladita  roadmap says, You buy a JPEG, and we make a movie.'   ""I hope filmmakers can greenlight themselves with the power of JPEGs.""    Miguel Faus   As film3 matures, the question is how this will evolve  will utility become more critical as investors and fans join, not for cultural and philosophical reasons, but for access to the stars and the reading room?""Imagine you're making a gangster movie. Today, you have to find degens who are into gangster movies. I'm certain there are some, but the pool from which you can find gangster film enthusiasts is small. In five years, when everyone has a wallet, every gangster film nut out there is a potential buyer of the NFTs for your film.""  The  Calladita  roadmap is very simple. There are no promises of a metaverse game or merchandise, no mention of DeFi or staking. But simplicity is no substitute for substance, and straybits is clear about how significant  Calladita  is as a benchmark.""Web3 paves the way to not only finance the filmmaking process, but also to have an input and be a part of its future and success as well."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6388d6e21fc8e9965d5ac5b0_tESWkLZNnLnK3j4t2jfmTFbDJ3mY8Eh01LaAXe0SyiID_QJ8bsCFX_r5JdmKF0-M-Q3u2AjbHZW5FLEqpq9R6wKhX4nMhbm7nZ-iiiMTFwPgtIXHJjkk_0rKOU_1QFHruWFdJpSaRPLv3P6V-m6rqzc5iM_X8Smxbn4kHKF-V4G-kJkQjy2uo-7FuSJ3.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Calladita' still  <a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xdcb68d47423d244319a5101eae78716affba8655/939""> #1539 </a> . </figcaption></figure> There will, for example, be a  Calladita  DAO. Once the film has premiered, 50% of the profits from the film will go to the DAO, where holders participate in the governance of the DAO, expressing their preferences about matters related to the DAO treasury.'  In a vacuum, that is interesting. Even more so when you remember who will be in the DAO  CryptoPunks, Apes, and Nouns: all of whom are early adopters. But more importantly, they share a vision and philosophy of the creator economy, of decentralisation, of removing the gatekeepers and putting artistic control back in the hands of the storytellers and filmmakers.  With the  Calladita  DAO, they can practise what they preach. They invested in  Calladita  to get a movie made. Will they continue down this road and use the DAO to build atop that single success?""It will depend on how the movie performs. It will be up to them."" Will there be a decentralised movie studio built from one of the first films funded by NFTs? Will the  Calladita  DAO will make that gangster film? Now that would be a story. ",3498

Before there were any well-trodden paths for web3 musicians to follow, Milo and a small group of fellow visionaries, including<a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/domino"" > Domino</a> and Vi©riti©, were pushing ahead into uncharted territory. His<a href=""https://www.niftysax.com/spheres/"" >  Spheres </a> collection laid a blueprint for the new monetisation models that web3 musicians use by default, and his subsequent work as a community builder and co-founder of the web3 label, Nifty Music, has had a lasting impact on this young industry. ""Now, of course, there's a whole thriving community of creators and collectors,"" says Milo.""But there was a time when nobody really wanted to hear about music and NFTs. But little by little, I saw the community start to grow.""  Growing up in central Italy, Milo was noticed for his musical talents early on and was admitted to the Conservatorio Rossini aged eleven, in the town of Pesaro.""Back then they were still accepting kids,"" he jokes. Founded by the 19-century Italian composer Gioachino Rossini, who was born in Pesaro in 1792, the institution's music programme was intensive and wide ranging, covering not only Milo's chosen instrument, the saxophone, but also piano, singing, composing, arranging, theory, and history.""It's the old way of learning,"" Milo says.""Really, it intended to make you into a complete' musician."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1948px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1948px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63b84e5c3d4da05bf9cc627f_000%5Bpreferred%5D%20Milo%20Lombardi%20(NiftySax)%20-%20Photo%20Credit%20to%20David%20Vendryes%20(9).JPG"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><em>Nifty Sax's traditional musical education at Conservatorio Rossini could scarcely have been more distinct to the nascent web3 music scene he has now inspired. </figcaption></figure> Graduating from the conservatoire eight years later, Milo took up a career as a performing jazz musician.""I just started playing in any bar or pub that would have me,"" he recalls.""Eventually I was doing corporate events and weddings to make money. On the side, I was doing the things that actually fulfilled me as a musician: writing music and playing jazz clubs.""  As with so many others, the pandemic was a turning point for Milo: the touring economy that he had always relied upon slowed to a standstill, and suddenly he had the time  and incentive  to consider the new career paths taking shape in web3.""I had been following blockchain for a while on the sidelines  I never invested, I never bought any Bitcoin, but I was always interested,"" he explains.""When I realised that there were real applications for web3 I thought, okay, maybe I can do this with music.'""  Milo's genesis collection stands out both for how early it came in the history of web3 music and for its ambition. In March 2021, Milo began releasing an original music NFT every day, for 100 days. Not only that, but each NFT would be accompanied by a unique artwork from a collaborating digital artist, defining a strategy that later musicians like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/jburn"" >Jburn</a> would come to follow. Of course, being an early adopter is not always easy, and Milo recalls that building interest in the project was a slow process. ""In the first ten or twenty days I don't think anybody realised it was happening,"" he laughs.""It took a while to get going, because nobody knew me and there were pretty much no music NFTs when I started. But it was a very exciting moment: for the first time in my life, I was there at the beginning of something new, something big. And I really wanted to surf that wave."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""56.206088992974244%"" data-rt-dimensions=""854:480"" data-page-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWLXP7OQNFs&t=2s""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZWLXP7OQNFs?start=2"" title=""""></iframe> </figure> By the time that he was ready to drop his second collection,  Spheres , people were starting to pay attention. Stylistically, Milo moved his music away from the wild, avant-garde compositions of his genesis release, and towards a relaxed and atmospheric sound, characterised by sparse melodic phrases and long reverb tails.  Beyond making his music more approachable, Milo also began to develop what has now become a signature rarity structure. Starting with the most common editions of ten,  Spheres  sequentially narrows down to a unique 1/1, with the rarest editions featuring unique visual traits. He was also one of the first musicians to make use of blind minting, to add a gamified element of chance to his auctions.  The collection would go on to sell out within 12 hours, and many, both inside and outside web3, began to take notice of Milo's work as an example of what the blockchain had made possible for musicians.""I thought, what will the blockchain allow me to do that I couldn't do before?'"" Milo recalls.""If I'm going to do NFTs, then I want to use all of the things that they make available  otherwise I might as well just release stuff on Bandcamp.""  Rather than focusing on an immediate follow up to  Spheres , Milo used his success to begin building up the web3 music scene itself for others to follow in his footsteps. He co-founded Nifty Music alongside Robin Spottiswoode, creating <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/web3-labels"">a new style of music label</a> that has subsequently helped launch the web3 careers of<a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/violetta-zironi"" > Violetta Zironi</a>,<a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/fifi-rong"" > Fifi Rong</a>, and Josh Savage, amongst others. At the same time, he began running educational Twitter Spaces to help onboard new artists, and designed a training programme for web3 musicians that ultimately became the <a href=""https://niftymusic.academy/"" >Nifty Music Academy</a>.  In both endeavours, Milo says his goal has been to empower his contemporaries to gain the skills to thrive within web3 independently.""I wanted to show musicians what was possible with this new technology,"" he says.""I wanted to do this because it's fun, and because I had had some success of my own and wanted to share that. My thinking was, let's go ahead and do it, I'll help you, and then you can go ahead and do it yourself next time'.""  Of course, Milo still finds time to create his own music. In early 2022, he collaborated with Fifi Rong on her  Harmony Collection , a deeply meditative collection of short musical works.""We wanted it to be a healing project, so we did it around the chakras. They say that there is a specific frequency for each chakra, so, for each work, I play that frequency as the root note, and then the other notes I play are part of that frequency's harmonic series. All the notes are resonating with the original chakra.""  He's also gearing up to release his next, as yet untitled, collection.""It's something completely different from  Genesis  and  Spheres ,"" he says.""It does include saxophone, but these are songs where I sing and play the piano. It's a big shift for me.""   ""I wanted to show musicians what was possible.""    Nifty Sax   It has been nearly two years since Milo first began his web3 music journey. Over that time, the space has grown from non-existent to a close-knit, dedicated community.""A lot of people who were making music NFTs back at the very start have left, but even more new people have come in,"" he reflects.""The community as a whole has grown, there's more variety, and I think a lot more people now understand the value of digital ownership. "" ""This next year is going to be quite interesting,"" Milo predicts.""We have proven that there can be a whole ecosystem for music. It's not about selling just one piece    you can sell an entire collection and can build a whole economy around an album."" ",2376

They often have a high barrier to entry as a creator,"" Justin says. By contrast, any artist can monetise their 3D digital collectibles and immersive experiences on Mona, where creativity is free and made accessible via a web browser.""We created a multiplayer interface to enter any virtual experience with a single click.""  As we spend more time connecting with others in virtual environments, Justin feels that""these experiences need to be rich, immersive, and interactive."" To achieve this high standard, creators need to have the best tools, and Justin hopes that they'll choose to use Mona.""All of our current and future digital experiences are built by creators. Naturally, Mona places the creator first.""  As a result, Mona has grown quickly amongst artistic and creative communities.""Mona has become the platform of choice for creators and artists who want to build high quality metaverse experiences,"" Justin claims, before giving the evidence:""creators on our platform comprise AAA game designers behind titles like Cyberpunk 2049 and some of the most prolific artists in web3, like XCOPY and Coldie.""

Nathaniel Stern on creating a cyber-natural future on the blockchain,nathaniel stern on creating a cyber natural future on the blockchain,Fri Feb 24 2023 12:50:30,"For Nathaniel Stern, life extends far further than the human experience. Connecting the dots between human feeling, nature, and technology, he explores the endless bounds of sensibility through his art. He speaks to Ola Kalejaye Kalejaye about The World After Us, and using art to ensure that world is good. ",Fri Feb 24 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Photography-2; Videography; Technology,Ola Kalejaye," When Nathaniel Stern speaks about his work, his passion for the subject matter enlivens the conversation, steering it down tangential alleyways that enlighten his process with glorious context, while also bringing a cascade of new and interesting insights.  Such are the makings of the eclectic mind of a natural polymath and interdisciplinary artist. Nathaniel holds a joint appointment at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, teaching both Art &amp; Design and Mechanical Engineering. It certainly scans for someone who embodies the mind of both artist and academic through the way they approach, well, everything.  Nathaniel expressed interest in a variety of creative media from a young age. The son of two English teachers, he first explored his creativity through music while attending an engineering high school. He went on to study fashion design at university, and it was there that Nathaniel faced the first major turning point of his artistic journey, and quite by chance. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:924px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""924px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63f8c4eec97cdb163128a8ae_Screenshot%202023-02-24%20at%2014.08.32.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://quantum.art/item/63e121504e17b4c8bed31d31"" > Wrong Number </a>  by Nathaniel Stern evokes the question,""What if the digital materials themselves started to incubate and fester and spread?"" </figcaption></figure> One of Nathaniel's undergraduate professors sent him a link to New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), which he interpreted as a suggestion that he apply. In reality, as Nathaniel learned a decade later, his professor had sent the link as a reference for what she wanted to hire Nathaniel to do with her own website, but the decision had already been made.  Founded in 1979, the NYU ITP explores communications technologies, and how they can serve as vessels to spread art. The programme is also well known for its contributions to interactive art, which has been one of Nathaniel's primary vehicles for expression.  During his time at NYU, Nathaniel explored the notion of performativity,""how text and activity intertwine."" A major guiding inspiration came from his teacher, Professor Dan O'Sullivan, who noted Nathaniel's particularly animated style of speaking, prompting him to explore the relationship between speech and the body.""That's where my two loves kind of came together,"" reflects Nathaniel.""It wound up completely changing my life. That's where I became an artist.""   ""What might that cyber-natural future look like?""    Nathaniel Stern   As Nathaniel's interests evolved, he honed in on his corporeal relationship to the environment, through the lens of  affect."" Affect   is the body's response to the environment that doesn't have a name yet,"" he explains.""It's an emotion without a qualification .""   One of his early explorations of this phenomenon was through a series of what he labels  Compressionist  images .  Nathaniel would make custom imaging rigs by attaching battery packs to desktop scanners, rigging them to his body and moving through different landscapes.  Nathaniel's experimental and ingenious project spanned over a decade, taking him and his imaging rigs scanning over hedges, through parks and streams, and wading through lakes and waterfalls. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63f8c637db29f9edb5954f0b_ezgif.com-optimize.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://quantum.art/item/63e11e144e17b4c8bed31c98"" > Dell in Bloom </a> , by Nathaniel Stern, explores the concept of nonhuman affect'. </figcaption></figure> He even spent three months learning to scuba dive with his equipment, to take his compressionist observations underwater. He and his team built five different sub-aqueous systems, and Nathaniel dived with three of them at three different sites.  Thanks to Nathaniel's uniquely unusual method of capturing these""melty, slit-scan images,"" the thoughts and questions they stimulated were beyond what Nathaniel could have ever planned. He was viewing the interrelationship between his body, technology, and the world around him in a wholly new way. He had found a way to visually represent  affect.   Nathaniel began to wonder, what if the landscapes that he had been surveying had their own, unprocessed responses. Could there be some kind of  nonhuman affect ? And if there was, how might it express itself in an environment increasingly tampered with by human activity? This exploration manifested itself in what is perhaps Nathaniel's signature work thus far, and the centre of his NFT collection launching on Quantum Art, <a href=""https://quantum.art/collection/the-world-after-us-by-nathaniel-stern"" > The World After Us </a> .   The title of the series is inspired by the book  The World Without Us , which explores the progress of planet Earth if humanity were to go extinct. In  The   World After Us,  he explores how biological life and the waste that humanity produces would intertwine in our absence. ""If matter can move and think and feel,"" Nathaniel asks,""what if it's not just the plants that retake the planet? What if the digital materials themselves started to incubate and fester and spread?""   The World After Us  is Nathaniel's representation of what such a future would look like. For him, that future is neither blindly optimistic, nor some post-apocalyptic dystopia.""I wanted to imagine a space that is full of garbage, but life finds a way, because it always does,"" he explains.""What might that cyber-natural future look like?""  The collection falls into three categories: old appliances reclaimed by plant life, fossilised phones and laptops, and devices repurposed into tools. Contemplating the future of our tech-driven society, Nathaniel's images recontextualise our relationship to these quotidian items. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:930px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""930px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63f8c51b5c0b767fefa8ec6d_Screenshot%202023-02-24%20at%2014.06.17.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://quantum.art/item/63e121504e17b4c8bed31d19"" > Double Ring </a>  is part of Nathaniel's  The   World After Us  collection, which explores a futuristic merging of technology and nature. </figcaption></figure>""How can I change my relationship to this thing?,"" he muses, asking both of himself and the viewer,""How do I understand it, no longer as this object of beauty and utility, but also as garbage.""  Art is just one platform through which Nathaniel pursues these aims. A self-professed""Jack-of-All-Trades"", Nathaniel co-founded the climate action startup, <a href=""https://www.eco-labs.xyz/"" >Eco Labs</a>, and sits on the Board of a battery company seeking to replace the lithium ion with the much more plentiful sodium ion in the battery-making process.  However, for Nathaniel, art provides the most important piece of the puzzle when it comes to inducing systematic changes to our attitudes on waste. Nathaniel quotes his friend and collaborator, the soil scientist Johannes Lehmann:I can tell you how to solve climate change, but we need artists to make everyone have the will to make that difference.""   ""What the blockchain has afforded me is that I get to live in both worlds at once.""    Nathaniel Stern   Nathaniel's appreciation that much of that will could be inspired by the blockchain required a 180-degree change in perspective, from contempt to admiration. Indeed, he intended to make a""critical and negative work"" about the blockchain with longtime collaborator Scott Kildall.  However, when Nathaniel and Scott began their research, their opinions swiftly changed.""We came to it and we were like, oh shit, there's something there,"" he explains.""Yeah, there are crypto bros, but there are also really earnest people who want to leverage its power.""  Nathaniel recalls finding the work of artists and writers in the blockchain space, such as Simon de la Rouviere, and future collaborators Rhea Myers and the AI-collaborative poet <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/sasha-stiles"" >Sasha Stiles</a> .  Their opinions on the blockchain firmly changed Nathaniel and Scott's perspectives, who decided to instead create a work celebrating the blockchain, starting Nathaniel's web3 journey in earnest.  To him, the NFT ecosystem provides a space for experimentation that had been eroding in the face of demands of galleries and museums, and more akin to the Net Art days of the 1990s.&nbsp;""I would just make something, throw it up, get feedback and see what happened,"" he reminisces.   By contrast, whilst a gallery would support his work, all experimentation had to happen behind the scenes. In providing Nathaniel the means to sell and distribute his work directly, web3 lets him pursue his true interests. ""What the blockchain has afforded me is that I get to live in both worlds at once.""  Top of mind for Nathaniel is a longstanding desire to archive his work, which the blockchain enables for a digital work far better than any gallery. Though he does not fully buy into the concept of the blockchain lasting forever, he does find the concept of permanent immutability on the blockchain to be""a beautiful idea."" ""The blockchain is already a promise we can't possibly keep,"" Nathaniel says, as he ponders what forever looks like, and beyond.""But I think that putting our trust in the trustless and timeless is itself beautiful. And romantic and cynical, and problematic and hopeful all at once."" ",2867
Leveraging digital assets for more: how liquidity protocols are breaking into NFT lending,nft liquidity,Tue Jun 28 2022 19:19:09,"Net wealth locked up in illiquid JPEGs is a running gag in crypto, but Ekin Geniß explores how handful of builders are creating DeFi-powered protocols to bring liquidity to the NFT market, and a slew of opportunities for the space.",Tue Jun 28 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Nft-Lending; Applications,Ekin Genc," Life imitates art, or is it the other way round? Net wealth locked up in illiquid JPEGs is a running gag in crypto. After all, liquidity is a huge pain point in NFT trading and investment. Meanwhile, having access to liquidity via your digital assets - whether they're JPEGs or not  "" unlocks the door to a wealth of opportunities and investment in web3. ""One of the issues with NFTs today is the fact that they are extremely illiquid, and the most popular ones are often worth quite a sum of money,"" says Steven, a founding member of Yunt Capital, an early-stage crypto fund and DAO, speaking to Culture3.  But a recent wave of blockchain protocols and platforms, powered by the tools of DeFi, is trying to change the liquidity game in NFTs. So far Steven has borrowed and fully repaid 231 wETH on <a href=""https://www.nftfi.com/"" >NFTfi</a>, an NFT lending protocol that's <a href=""https://dune.com/rchen8/NFTfi"" >facilitated</a> over 12,000 loans worth a collective $208 million (¬£170 million). Finding a counterparty for NFT trades on short notice is often tricky, he said, and""being able to take an over collateralised loan against your NFTs is much needed in the space."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3800px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62c3487436f718a071d9069e_upscaler-doodles%20man-2x.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Harri and a friend, pictured with the pickup truck he bought after collateralising his Doodles NFT (credit: Harri, via  <a href=""https://twitter.com/NFTfi/status/1509286822383337477""> NFTfi </a> ). </figcaption></figure> The potential for NFT lending is massive, even by conservative estimates.""Over the next 6-12 months we could observe an almost Cambrian explosion of NFT financialisation projects,"" predicts Steph Kunkelen Young, CEO of NFTfi, adding that ""we can now clearly see the outlines of the emerging NFT finance space."" He explains that compared to other similar markets, only a very small slice of NFTs are used as collateral.  When it comes to traditional art and collectibles, 20% of the value of those markets are locked up as collateral to let their owners access liquidity; the value of real estate collateral used for borrowing is a full 50% of the total real estate sector. By contrast, NFT lending currently represents just 1% of the overall NFT market. That gives some illustration of the significant growth potential for NFT lending  "" even if the NFT market remains at the current levels.  Access to liquidity is a big deal. By helping asset owners raise capital, lending can and unlock new opportunities and investments. In March, an NFT photographer named Harri <a href=""https://twitter.com/NFTfi/status/1509286815659921415"" >appealed to lenders on NFTfi</a>: he needed to buy an off-road vehicle to bring aid to Ukraine, and was using his Doodle as collateral. Young explains that""one of the lenders on NFTfi stepped in and provided a 0% APR loan right away. Just a few minutes later, Harri had 4 ETH in his wallet.""   ""Over the next 6-12 months we could observe an almost Cambrian explosion of NFT financialisation projects.""    Steph Kunkelen Young, CEO of NFTfi   Collateralising digital assets like NFTs is uncommon, but the concept is certainly proven. YouTuber Mike Majlak, who last April bought Bored Ape #9049, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHt7tiKu6Hg"">told the story</a> of how he later needed cash to pay the deposit for his new home. Unwilling to sell the furry JPEG, Majlak collateralised it instead for a 200,000 USDC loan. In doing so, he may have become""the first person to leverage an NFT to buy a house""  "" or at least the first to go public about it. ""Mike contacted us a few weeks ago about his idea to collateralise a BAYC NFT for a down payment on a home he was buying. We appraised his asset and found a lender willing to fund the loan,"" says Gabe Frank, founder of Arcade, the NFT liquidity protocol that has facilitated a total loan volume of <a href=""https://dune.com/sdlep/Arcade-Loan-Volume"">$15 million</a> to date. Arcade is one of the larger players in the decentralised NFT liquidity sector, where companies connect creditors with borrowers. Pine operates a competing lending protocol in which pools have so far lent out <a href=""https://app.pine.loans/pools/?page=1"">$1 million</a>, whilst JPEG'd specialises in lending against blue-chip NFT collections like CryptoPunks, with <a href=""https://jpegd.io/"">$8.13 million</a> on its books to lend (the Total Value Locked in by creditors).  Another innovative use is the NFT mortgage' strategy, exemplified by Pine's other service, its <a href=""https://app.pine.loans/pnpl/"">'pine-now-pay-later'</a> protocol. Borrowers can pay a deposit towards an NFT purchase and immediately collateraliase the asset in the same transaction, as one would do to buy a house, but without the paperwork. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2233px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2233px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62c3504103b041d9020f1eea_lE57zCLW_4x-mineee.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Mike Majlak used his Bored Ape ( <a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/9049""> #9049 </a> ) as collateral to borrow 200,000 USDC for a deposit for a new house. </figcaption></figure> Darius Kozlovskis explains that NFT leverage' is increasingly popular at <a href=""https://drops.co/"">Drops</a>, the NFT liquidity protocol he founded. Customers can take this far further than a mortgage on one digital asset, and can even collateralise a handful of NFTs (often two or three) to borrow ETH and buy more NFTs from the same collection with the borrowed capital.""That way users with conviction get the biggest exposure to their favourite NFT collection,"" Kozlovskis said.""I didn't think people would do that, but I saw the possibility of using it as leverage."" Drops has supplied a total of $3 million in loans so far.  Unlike traditional DeFi lending protocols like Aave, maximum loan-to-value ratios are often less stringent in NFT lending, meaning that more cryptocurrency can be borrowed in a loan for a specific asset with a given value. Those who set up lending pools can decide what LTV ratios they will accept, but the common practice for Pine pools is to have a right to recall loans with LTVs above 95%, according to Alex Ho, Head of Product at Pine.  For example, you might collateralise an asset worth 180 eth and borrow 95 eth, implying an LTV ratio of 50%. But the asset could decline in value, meaning that creditors would get paid out less in the event of a default. To mitigate this risk, creditors can recall a loan when the asset depreciates by a certain amount; the 95% threshold would be reached when the asset fell to 100 eth. Frank has observed many lenders on Arcade preparing for more frequent defaults.""We're seeing a lot of lenders tighten up on LTVs and the type of collateral they accept. Most lenders are bullish on the underlying collateral, though.""  NFT lending primarily benefits investors with high-value, illiquid NFTs who are seeking capital to make a purchase or investment, but creators can also benefit from the practice.""We're in a sort of creator renaissance' right now, and NFTs are how digital IP gets transferred and captured. So I think there is a lot to explore,"" Frank told Culture3.""Some ideas would be loans against previous works to finance the next piece, or reserve bids.""  Young explains that NFT loans already increase the value of NFTs for creators: when investors access liquidity without selling, removing downward pressure on the floor price. Further, creators often hold their own collections themselves, meaning they can also leverage their assets to access liquidity without creating downward price pressure. That provides them with the financial flexibility to grow their community and make genuine progress in their work.  But what gets builders most excited is the fact that the technology to provide liquidity for NFTs is not necessarily limited to digital assets. Kozlovskis argues that Drops is well-positioned for the future development of the sector.""I believe that tokenisation brokerages will start popping up that will allow tokenising real-world assets. Our underlying technology will be able to support those NFTs as well. Perhaps KYC will be required in some cases, but it's definitely an area where the market will be progressing."" If this happens, holders of illiquid assets across the world will have access to a far larger pool of lenders to borrow from, providing them with further opportunities to invest in themselves and their enterprises.   ""More and more titles will become NFTs, and so our total addressable market is 40 trillion, taking into account global assets. Not 4 billion or so of the total JPEG NFT market cap,"" says Ho. If that's even slightly true, JPEGs are just a tiny fraction of the market over the long term, heralding a major change in how asset holders access liquidity in the 21st century. ",2664
Kick-off at NFT.NYC: coverage from the ground,nft nyc coverage 1,Wed Jun 29 2022 17:54:29,Culture3 had boots on the ground to capture NFT.NYC and witness how the world's biggest NFT conference was holding up in the bear market.,Mon Jun 20 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Community-society,Conferences; Nft-Nyc,Randy Ginsburg," Bringing together over 15,000 NFT collectors, artists, developers, and creatives, NFT.NYC kicked off to huge excitement last month. The inaugural conference began on June 20th, spanning five venues and featuring hundreds of speakers and thousands of satellite events across the city.  While it's impossible to catch everything, we've tried our best to capture the top stories, news, and presentations from across the week. Fashion, gaming, and film had a particularly strong conference.  Tactics to make your fashion NFTs crush it   Kicking off the digital fashion track on a high note, we visited the Edison Ballroom to hear from an influential panel of digital fashion experts in every relevant field. Fashion was covered by Marco Marchesi, CTO of The Fabricant, and Natalie Johnson, Founder of Nueno, both digital fashion houses. Consultancy executives Nico Fara, founder of Chief Metaverse Officer, and Jessica Greenwalt, Creative Director at VaynerNFT, covered the metaverse. Ashli Weiss, founder of Weiss Law, brought the legal perspective, whilst Nelly Mensah, VP of Digital Innovation at LVMH, explained how the biggest fashion brands in the space are thinking about web3.  NFTs as loyalty programmes   Use NFTs to enhance your existing brand and product, but don't try to be something you're not. People love Coach because they make quality bags and shoes, not because they build immersive tech products. Fashion NFTs like digital twins and exclusive collectibles can be used to reward your superfans with limited edition products, exclusive shopping events, or creative direction in future design processes. These are the experiences that many web2' customers really want. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62bc912640e89480b97c9ff3_HAcqhDUMAt0JcztwfdKVw2Qjs5vpLi1uTiPQfTcenzIHXDyw5AknAlEIuZMQQO6tti9YgRdI5XqQVwob5SA3dmVWOOWuFhNUzgRW1UTGKGrAthBoMZi3q5ddwlqVOC8ZhdEkJc3TZAWNyyse3A.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Panellists at the 'Tactics to make your fashion NFTs crush it', from left to right: Ashli Weiss (Weiss Law), Nelly Mensah (LVMH), Marcho Marchesi (The Fabricant), Jessica Greenwalt (VaynerNFT), and Natalie Johnson (Neuno). </figcaption></figure> Don't rush your strategy   Many brands missed the boat on social media and ecommerce, and now feel compelled to jump headfirst into the next new thing. Before hastily launching a Web3 strategy, always consider the  why.   Why  do you want to create a metaverse store?  Why  do you want to launch a Discord?  Why  would your customer want this offering?   Amidst the hype, it's easy to forget the reason these technologies matter to fashion brands: to create value for customers.  Bridging web2 and web3   Mensah encouraged Web2 brands to take what works for them in Web2 and apply it to Web3. In luxury fashion, the brightest minds in the industry are responsible for throwing fashion shows where  every  detail is considered. The LVMH executive explained that the same standards should apply to minting experiences and NFT rollouts.  Unlocking new creative opportunities   Marchesi argued that   the beauty of The Fabricant lies not in the garments that are created ,  but in the   evolution of an ecosystem where people can co-create, trade, and make a living fromtheir creativity. In the traditional fashion industry, with major companies profit significantly from the creative work of designers. With their new Studio, The Fabricant's overarching mission is to disrupt the creative fashion economy and unlock new income streams for independent designers.  Polygon's vision for the future of NFTs in gaming   Next, we jumped over to Radio City Music Hall to catch Polygon Studios CEO Ryan Wyatt dive into the world of blockchain gaming. Polygon is one of the largest scaling protocols on Ethereum, whilst Polygon Studios is working to make it easy for developers to integrate web3 elements into their games.  To kick off his presentation, Ryan discussed his jump from web2 to web3. As the Head of Gaming at YouTube for eight years, Ryan noticed an undeniable shift in the industry. After years of spending billions of dollars on non-transferable in-game digital items, users are craving digital ownership. With the rise of blockchain gaming, users now receive genuine, verifiable ownership of their downloadable content, the ability to carry it across worlds, and resell it in secondary markets. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:54%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""54%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62bdc52989ddc41437a35c43_hY2S4MI_VnaGm0_U4KYLoBOGrkgkAe5UFtRX6Eod7wZerKZWPhntV4azWeBzxw24ajWrLv6r3ZzZjl25pmKcaJmqnqxw8BbhQrh5Wi88d6J-yx_2FishXa7ra5GUyn27GLgbLrlc4e1EblVQ1Q.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Ryan Wyatt, CEO of Polygon Studios, speaking at Radio City Hall. Polygon is one of the largest scaling platforms on Ethereum. </figcaption></figure> Building the technology and infrastructure needed to scale such demands is easier said than done. Complex tokenomics, janky onboarding processes, and the pressure of delivering timely roadmaps all play a large role in attracting and retaining a user's attention - and ultimately, the user experience in web3 is not a great one.  While still early in the journey, Wyatt recapped their top learnings so far. Making games is already difficult, but adding tokenomics makes it harder, not least because gamers have historically resisted structural change. High-quality game develop and unique products need to be brought to market to remove the sceptism around blockchain in gaming. Partly because of this, web3 game developers want to work with gaming industry veterans as well as crypto-natives; you need both to get far in this sector. That said, there are plenty of ways to get far. With a diverse range of technologies from internet protocols like supernetworks, to consensus mechanisms like proof of stake, to other blockchain innovations like zero-knowledge proofs and the Ethereum Virtual Machine, there are many ways to build and a wealth of new opportunities.  Future of film and NFTs   In the afternoon session, legendary filmmaker and  She's Gotta Have It  director Spike Lee graced the stage to discuss how NFTs are changing the way films are made.   ""Don't bet the house.""   Spike Lee, filmmaker   Spike kicked off the conversation by acknowledging the importance of IP ownership within your creative work. With full ownership of his IP from  She's Gotta Have It , Lee shared his plans to release over 3,000 NFTs of the original 35mm film prints of the famous character, Mars Blackmon.

Throughout the presentation, Spike encouraged listeners to play the long game and not chase the money.

In full swing at NFT.NYC: coverage from the ground,nft nyc coverage 2,Wed Jun 29 2022 17:55:11,"Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg reports from an ever-bustling New York city swarmed with web3 panels, parties, and other events. Today's diary explores all angles on IP in web3, plus a historic basketball tournament held by the Krause House.",Wed Jun 22 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Community-society,Conferences; Nft-Nyc; Ip; Krause-House,Randy Ginsburg," Building on the energy from day one, day two of NFT.NYC was even busier than expected. We spent most of the day at the event's premier venue, the Marriott Marquis. With theatres and booth displays covering floors three to eight, there was no shortage of opportunities to connect with bright minds from all over the world.  Fewer scams, more collabs: the future of content moderation in web3   We kicked off the day with a timely and important discussion around safety in the web3 community. For all the good that web3 technologies bring, it is a nascent space, and comes with a lot of dishonesty and deceit at the same time. In order for this technology to be adopted by the masses, that needs to change.  We heard from a range of experts about how they're tackling this issue. James Curran is founder of the Random Character Collective (RCC), a web3 creator community behind projects like SlimHoods and MoodRollers. Invisible Friends, created by Markus Magnusson, is another RCC project, and coinbilly, Head of Stuff at Invisible Friends, was on the panel too. Meanwhile, Anne Fauvre-Willis, VP of Special Projects at OpenSea, and Liat Karpel Gurwicz, CMO of DeviantArt, also sat on the panel, and they were also joined by Andrey Doronichev, a former Googler who is the co-founder of Mesto, a Russian-speaking entrepreneurship community. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:45%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""45%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62bdcb4d6d98a3daf98b9be2_iNUJs12_uEZH-1VyGZ42n4BfThIqkopVclw-UGyP9cZ0VfdjOdLcEJuUZUne4OivsxLyMJ9jkdPbwkNkCCZE_c2v1ALqbhzrWMFzLqgaRvbJIWaWWOuEz3gpp9OxReeiweMkAUgxzg4KtLFPsQ.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Inside the Marriott Marquis, in many ways the home of NFT.NYC 2022. </figcaption></figure> OpenSea takes down thousands of scam collections per week. Fauvre-Willis alluded to numerous upcoming initiatives to curb fraudulent projects from the root up. On top of bringing the applications to verify for verified projects in-house, OpenSea will be investing heavily in discoverability, making it easier to elevate legitimate collections and allowing users to find what they are looking for. OpenSea is also building tools to record IP licences and flag which projects permit derivative versions. Not only will creators be able to specify the extent of the variations they will permit on their artwork, but it will also give the world's largest NFT marketplace better tools to monitor and prevent scam collections.  But it is important to note that scamming and dishonesty are not only OpenSea problems, or those for other marketplaces, but problems for everyone in the space, particularly creators and consumers. The panel agreed that the responsibility of this issue should not be borne by a single person or entity in the ecosystem, but should be addressed collectively by all companies, projects, and collectors. In particular, project founders can emphasise scam safety education for both newcomers and experienced traders, improve security measures within Discords, and should have backup compensation plans in place if their communities get hacked.  NFTs: the multi-layered copyright cake  In one of the most informative and well-spoken panels of the week, Jeremy Goldman, partner at Frankfurt Kurnit Klein &amp; Selz and co-chair of the law firm's Blockchain Group, delved deep into the important and oft controversial topic of copyright. Under US copyright law, copyright holders have the exclusives rights to perform, display, or distribute a piece work publicly, and to prepare derivative works based on the original copyrighted piece.  But there is an important distinction between the ownership of a copyright and the ownership of the material object in which a copyrighted work is embedded. For example, if you own an original Van Gogh painting, you own the material object of the work, but not necessarily the right to perform any of the exclusive rights listed in law.  Only if the original creator relinquishes all copyright ownership to the public domain via a Creative Commons Zero licence (CC0) does the holder of a material object gain the ability to distribute, perform, or display the copyrighted work publicly, or reproduce it or any derivatives at all. The innovation of NFTs is to interact with an additional, mid-level of ownership, called token ownership, which references the exclusive right to edit the 'owner' field of an asset on the blockchain, which is part of its metadata. It is this right to prescribe ownership of digital and material assets on the blockchain that makes NFTs such a compelling value proposition.  Events   Sports DAO <a href=""https://www.krausehouse.club/"" >Krause House</a> made history on Wednesday by successfully hosting eight pro teams for a single-elimination 3-on-3 basketball tournament on the world's first custom-built NFT court. The court is now being fractionalized into over 1,000 pieces and sold as NFTs. In addition to receiving a physical piece of the court and digital artwork, all NFT holders wil gain access to the Krause House community and an ownership stake in the DAO's recently-acquired <a href=""https://big3.com/news/decentralized-autonomous-organization-krause-house-to-purchase-fire-tier-ownership-nft-allotment-for-ball-hogs-big3-team/"">BIG3 team</a>. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62bdcb4e6d98a322388b9ee1_mdWroJM9-iiBp2wlu9E1nNZnD62VcYf04ErTGB-Bjdi7_g74JFgWoxZdxlhYIvp6rkrJWr7xcJKztnCC0meRyzx11KXs3U0uD0iVoJqs1valxx8KtPjiMVPBozYhWZsauCGRFKptocKMyGoHsA.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Snoop Dogg, Eminem, and Spottie Wifi were amongst the musicians playing at ApeFest 2022. </figcaption></figure> On Tuesday and Wednesday, The Sandbox threw two incredible events at Gotham Hall.

Closing thoughts at NFT.NYC,nft nyc coverage 3,Wed Jun 29 2022 17:55:46,"Closing thoughts from Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg on NFT.NYC: why the community is what makes web3 special, why the space needs more mature voices, and why he'll see you there next year.",Mon Jun 27 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Community-society,Conferences; Nft-Nyc,Randy Ginsburg," Many days removed from the NFT.NYC festivities, it's time for an honest, unfiltered opinion of last month's headline conference. All in all, it was a mild success, in that it achieved its goal of bringing more awareness, education, and excitement to the broader NFT community. Over 15,000 people attended the main event, with thousands more branching out to various satellite events across the city. That's over three times more than the 5,000 attendees who signed up last year, even with the NFT market in the gutter.  To throw an event of this magnitude and scale is no easy task, and from what I could see, the execution was seamless. Ticketing was smooth, free food was readily available, and there were plenty of staff members to answer questions whenever needed. Bravo, bravo. Of course, others like <a href=""https://twitter.com/anonsvoice/status/1539005025271291906"" >Anonymous</a> had different experiences, particularly with respect to the pre-event planning, so it's important to note that this is just one subjective opinion of how the week unfolded.   Similar to last year, the satellite events were largely the highlight of the week. It was amazing to see the creativity, scrappiness, and true community demonstrated by many companies, projects, and protocols that were no more than a pipe dream a short twelve to sixteen months ago. The parties were lavish, well-catered, and widely broadcasted across social media.  But still, despite all the good that came from the event, there was even more that left me confused, disappointed, and even a bit frustrated. <figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2400px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2400px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62be09bd7bbe8b37556339cd_nft-conference-2.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""> </figure> First and foremost, my personal view is that the event itself did not deliver $700 worth of value to its attendees. Thank goodness   I had a media pass   because if I had paid full price for a ticket, well, our trusty editor would be filtering out a hell of a lot of swear words. While this is only one perception of the week and it's likely there were many excellent events I could have attended, there are a few crucial areas that those affiliated with the conference need to address to give NFT.NYC some much-needed credibility, beyond a good excuse to get wildly inebriated with a crowd of internet friends and strangers.  Speakers and venues   The event featured over 1,500 speakers, some of whom admitted to only joining the space a few months prior. A  tenth  of the people attending the event were speaking. There was a clear emphasis on speaker quantity over quality, likely driven by the goal of squeezing as much partnership and sponsorship revenue out of the event as possible.  Of course, there are not 1,500 experts out there qualified to speak about NFTs. Furthermore, letting  anyone  speak heavily dilutes the credibility of the few noteworthy speakers who are deserving of their spot on stage. It also defeats the purpose of the event as an educational resource, whilst the sheer amount of programming at conflicting times left some panels widely unattended. A waste of time and effort for all.  In one of the classic quotes of the week, as reported by CoinDesk:The programming this year sucks, the panelists have no idea what they're talking about, I'm never coming back,"" one attendee was overheard saying to another in line for an after-party.""There are panels?"" the other responded.   I rest my case.  Target audience   Most of the speakers were targeting an audience either of corporate executives or NFT novices, rather than the true builders in the space. Unfortunately, very few panels contained anything of substance. No new insights, statistics, or forecasts, just buzzwords and promotional underpinnings.  We need more deep thinking about what is actually useful in the space, and fewer abstract, regurgitated scripts about how 'NFTs will serve as a way to bypass centralised third parties and transform X industry' by unlocking new ways for brands to connect with their true fans'. Indeed, nearly every panel featured a spokesperson from a company or an NFT.NYC sponsor  "" sometimes both  "" who was not-so-subtly trying to shill a project or platform. There were very few panels I attended where there wasn't at least one collective groan from the audience over some cringe-worthy, or just wildly inaccurate, comment made by a speaker.  Lack of diversity   This isn't so much for the event, but rather the space as a whole. Simply white men, everywhere; the space has a lot to do to onboard women and people of colour to the space.  But I want to end on a positive note and give some much-deserved praise to the people I met, the highlight the event. Never before have I been surrounded by a more intelligent, welcoming, and ego-free group of people. After over a year of Twitter communication hidden behind cartoon PFPs, it was amazing to connect with newfound friends (and strangers) from all around the world and bond over something as  silly  as NFTs.  I heard a great quote during a panel featuring Autograph co-founder Dillon Rosenblatt. He compared the loyalty of NFT holders to that of sports fans, and to a large degree, it's true.  Think of your favorite football team. If you saw someone wearing its jersey in a bar, you'd likely go out of your way to make conversation with them. The same applies to those in the NFT community, especially those who hold the same NFTs as you do.  While there is an undeniable sense of false positivity amongst the NFT community, there  was  a sense of genuine positivity  despite the thousands of dollars that have been lost by many in the most recent downturn. It was very clear to see the people who were truly driven by the potential of the technology, and who was there, by contrast, just to pump their bags or make their boss happy. And for those who find themselves in the first group, I salute you and look forward to what's to come. Until next year.  ç  ç ",1752

Hosted next to the Eiffel Tower; esteemed web3 speakers like Yuga Labs co-founder Greg Solano; world-leading brands like LVMH and Salesforce. To add to the prestige, multiple representatives of the French government, including Jean-Noi´l Barrot, Minister for Digital, and Brigitte Macron, stopped by at the accessibly priced event.  The queue began to build from 9am, winding around the Champ de Mars park. Soon after, group chats and Twitter feeds started to blow up with images from inside the Grand Palais iâphi©mi®re and the view of the Eiffel Tower next door. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:4032px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""4032px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63fccdc07b907ebe8d026022_PXL_20230224_102603854%20(1).jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > With 18,000 visitors from February 24th-25th, NFT Paris is one of Europe's most popular web3 conferences to date. </figcaption></figure> Progressing from 500 people last year to 18,000 in 2023, NFT Paris generally coped with the step up, despite logistical difficulties for long queues at entry, food stalls, and, given the space and weight restrictions of the Grand Palais iâphi©mi®re's elevated second floor, the main stage. (The structure is a temporary replacement for the Grand Palais, undergoing renovations ahead of the 2024 Olympics;  iâphi©mi®re  means short-lived' in French.)  However, those difficulties were minor irritations overall, paling in comparison to the palpable enthusiasm that spread across the entire venue. Whilst the Grand Palais iâphi©mi®re venue itself may be short-lived, the event to which it played host emphatically demonstrated that NFTs are here to stay.  The area where NFT Paris truly excelled was the speaker line-up. It is unlikely that any conference this year will beat the NFT Paris agenda, featuring top-tier leaders from both NFTs and the business world, including Sebastien Borget, co-founder of The Sandbox; Nicolas Julia, founder of Sorare; Yat Siu, founder of Animoca Brands; as well as leaders from NFT communities like Yuga Labs, PROOF, Doodles, Pudgy Penguins, and rekt guy, plus executives from LVMH, Salesforce, Warner Bros., and Shopify. ""With NFT Paris, we wanted to build a new standard for the entire industry in terms of curation and quality, and to create a beacon for creative minds from all around the world,"" Ci¥me Prost-Boucle, co-founder of NFT Paris, tells Culture3.""Our vision was to build a cultural event rather than a crypto or tech event. With more than 18,000 visitors over the two days, that bet received an incredible validation from the market.""  In particular, NFT Paris was a conference for web3's Twitter community, with those most popular on the social media platform attracting the biggest crowds. The lineup was certainly impressive, which inevitably introduces the problem of packing everything in for a two-day agenda. With panels all 35 minutes or longer, there was enough time to get into an interesting discussion and hear a range of perspectives, though not enough to dive deep into a topic. And for those unable to reach the main stage, simulcasts were only a partial substitute, particularly for those too far away to hear the uncaptioned livestream.  Nonetheless, side-events provided an excellent complement. Panels at NFT Factory Paris during the week lasted an hour. Whilst this variety in the events could have been integrated into the main agenda, which also lacked true workshop events, NFT Paris deserves credit for creating a valuable hub in which thousands of web3 innovators could gather and connect.  These side-events allowed for a more intimate and curated environment to meet specific groups of people. Throughout the week, various galleries hosted openings and multiple shows drew throngs of artists and collectors. NFT Factory Paris, located across from the Centre Pompidou and considered the heart of the NFT community in the French capital, organised themed days focusing on particular genres, such as generative or AI art, which provided a dedicated space for like-minded people to meet and engage with others away from the throng of the main conference.   ""It's exciting to see so much momentum in web3 in Europe.""    Jonathan Perkins, co-founder, SuperRare   Similar variety could be found amongst the companies exhibiting across the 10,000 square metre floor. Though generally a consumer audience rather than an enterprise one, a wide range of organisations had a positive experience, from blockchains like Tezos to PFP communities like Renga; all felt buoyed by unending enthusiasm and crowds at their booths. ""It's exciting to see so much momentum in web3 in Europe, and to see genuine engagement from the French government  "" we were honoured to have visits from both Brigitte Macron and the Minister of Culture at the SuperRare booth,"" Jonathan Perkins tells Culture3, co-founder of SuperRare, whose Botto exhibit demonstrated the best of AI and community-led art. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2400px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2400px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63fcd17264b3e7bb180e8342_gpe.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > NFT Paris 2023 was set at the Grand Palais iâphi©mi®re, nextdoor to the Eiffel Tower in the Champ de Mars park. </figcaption></figure> Paris proved to be an excellent location. The City of Lights is home to major web3 companies like Ledger, Sorare, and The Sandbox, and with significant support from the French government, last week's conference consolidated the city as Europe's leading hub in web3. Indeed, France was one of the first countries in the world to introduce a regulatory framework for digital assets <a href=""https://www.cliffordchance.com/content/dam/cliffordchance/briefings/2019/07/france-leads-the-way-with-a-dedicated-legal-regime-for-digital-assets-and-icos.pdf"" >in 2019</a>, creating more regulatory certainty for blockchain companies in the nation.  The French capital is also the birthplace of one of the first crypto art galleries, IHAM Gallery, whilst the NFT Factory was made possible by the web3 community in Paris; 100 members contributed to build the location and operate a rotating schedule to keep the place open. Paris continues to write art history and claim the European mantle as the contemporary centre of new technological progress. In demonstrating that NFTs are far from dead, NFT Paris will continue to play a key role in growing the reputation not only of web3, but of France. ",1943

But buying property with Bitcoin or Ethereum is the least interesting part of what blockchain can offer real estate. Though NFT technology that can verify ownership of digital assets, web3 has the potential to drastically change the entire process from behind the scenes.  Some countries, like the <a href=""https://www.wiggin.co.uk/insight/uk-high-court-recognises-nfts-as-legal-property/"" >UK</a>, are beginning to recognise NFTs as legal property, but strictly speaking, they cannot yet function as a title deed, since no legal system yet recognises them in that capacity.

Bringing NFTs to real estate can bring greater transparency (with all purchase histories stored publicly, onchain), accelerate the process (through digitisation and automating many of the steps via smart contracts), and globalising the real estate market (by bringing it truly online). In addition, by verifying unique ownership, bringing property deeds on-chain has the added benefit of preventing scammers attempting to insert themselves into foreclosure, loan, and purchase processes.  In 2019, Mishcon de Reya, the London Magic Circle law firm, collaborated with the UK Government and University College London to develop a distributed ledger technology prototype that would enable a digital transfer of a property which automatically updates the UK Government's Land Register.

But all of these approaches are currently in the pilot stage; no jurisdiction legally accommodates direct title deed transfers via NFTs today.""I think this would be one way to transfer ownership of properties. I am all for it,"" Okada said. However, he accepts that mass adoption of NFTs as title deeds will take time: many steps have to be taken to get there, including legal and industry-wide changes to bring real estate transactions on chain, including governmants creating or regulating specific blockchains for the purpose.  Okada's Manhattan property puts a JPEG NFT in the centrepiece, but it's not the only way to transact real estate via NFTs. Propy is an American real estate company that's sold three properties by representing their ownership in a limited liability company (LLC) and selling that as an NFT instead.  Following an initial sale in Kiev, Propy have completed a string of sales across the US, with an upcoming sale in Orlando, Florida.""What's exciting about this upcoming NFT sale is that it provides a small royalty to the listing agent and seller for future sales of the NFT,"" according to Semra Dosevre, Propy's marketing manager.  When a property goes up for sale on Propy Marketplace, potential buyers have a pre-set amount of time to make offers. It's all transparent, true to the web3 ethos. In the end, the highest bidder transfers the amount in cryptocurrency to the seller, and the NFT is transferred into the buyer's wallet in approximately 15 minutes. Earlier this year, South Burlington, a city in Vermont with around 18,000 people, began a <a href=""https://www.govtech.com/biz/vermont-city-real-estate-startup-try-out-blockchain-for-recording-property-transactions.html"" >pilot</a> with Propy that could ultimately lead to the city putting the land registry entirely onchain. Speaking to <a href=""https://www.govtech.com/biz/heres-what-a-blockchain-property-deed-looks-like.html"" >govtech.com</a>, City Clerk Donna Kinville said her office didn't do anything differently when processing the Propy deed; the company oversaw the entire blockchain recording. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1323px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1323px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62c5fcc8cbf891089ecf7f17_Deed.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > A blockchain property deed used by South Burlington, Vermont, facilitated by Propy in 2018.

His property, located in war-torn Kiev, may be""intact, damaged, or destroyed,"" says Bernard, who has heard of destruction in the neighbourhood. But he isn't concerned about the state of the property.""My primary concern is about the people, I would like everyone to be safe and happy."" If the property outlasts the war, he hopes to""offer short-term rentals for the property and let the web3 community visit.""  One idea that Bernard finds particularly appealing is the prospect of fractionalising the property, turning the non-fungible token into many smaller fungible tokens backed by the real-world asset. It would be fun if everyone could own a piece, he suggests, noting that it""would likely require considerable legal effort to ensure compliance with various regulations."" ""I believe crypto will eventually make real estate transfers faster, cheaper, and more secure and will increase accessibility and affordability via fractionalisation,"" Bernard predicts.""The tech is ready, it will just take time for regulators to decide the appropriate safeguards."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center"" style=""padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""33.723653395784545%"" data-rt-dimensions=""854:480"" data-page-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnxkP_kMgjs""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/EnxkP_kMgjs"" title=""First Real Estate Sold as an NFT - Devon Bernard (NFT Property Owner): Episode 30""></iframe> </figure> Unlike others who experimented with NFT real estate, Okada &amp; Company chose not to go down the LLC route because. Okada explains that""taking over someone's LLC means that you inherit all their tax basis, any potential lawsuits, contracts with vendors, and so on."" He suggests that such a scenario could devalue a property in the real world by 20-30%.""The buyer would have to find an investigative company to do a search on any potential issues that the other LLC agreed to,"" he said.""In the commercial real estate world, [the LLC route] is a big red flag. People do it to save on transfer tax and capital gains, but never get fair market value.""  Although bringing NFTs to real estate could potentially transform many aspects of it, some issues are likely to remain untouched. Many real-world issues like theft, vandalism or rental problems cannot be enforced through onchain contracts and Bernard anticipates that""you'll still need to [use] the court system for resolving disputes.""  But the idea behind combining NFTs and real estate is not to bring every aspect of the sector onchain. Rather, it is to augment the process through specific technologies like smart contracts, blockchain, and NFTs, which reduce bottlenecks, improve transparency and security, and broaden accessibility and thus liquidity in the sector. Through this, web3 can leave a significant mark on the $200 trillion industry. ",3006
Ticket inspection: taking a closer look at the NFT use case that's already here,nft ticketing,Thu Jun 23 2022 23:12:31,"Ticketing is an industry with glaring problems, from scalping to fraud to scams. Ekin Geniß explores how NFTs present a fundamental fix to a major industry and speaks to the builders working on scaling a technology that has already been adopted by the likes of Lewis Capaldi, Ticketmaster, and UEFA.",Wed Jun 22 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Ticketing; Use-Cases; Applications,Ekin Genc," Getting a train ticket or a museum pass is often a smooth experience. Just pay online and show the QR code on your phone upon arrival. But it's a wildly different experience when you try to snag tickets for a much-hyped gig or a football game  especially when you have to resort to secondary markets, often rife with scams and grifters.  Ticketing is a <a href=""https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/event-tickets/worldwide"" >$72 billion industry</a> that can be incredibly frustrating for venues, fans, and artists  "" indeed, performers of all types.""To all our Fans Around the World: Help Us to Stop the Ticket Touts,"" British band Mumford &amp; Sons <a href=""https://www.mumfordandsons.com/news/to-all-our-fans-around-the-world-help-us-to-stop-the-ticket-touts/"" >wrote in 2015</a>.""Many tickets on secondary sites are being sold by touts who are simply in the business of ripping off the fan by charging an extortionate amount for sold out shows."" Nothing has stopped""very sophisticated"" resellers who con buyers and ticket issuers in a myriad of ways, they said, including breaking the software code and faking identities.  For years, it has seemed that for whatever solution creators and venues tried, ticket touts were always one step ahead. However, with NFTs enabled by smart contract technology, venues and creators have the technology stack that feels almost ready-made for the ticketing industry's woes. As a result, <a href=""https://blog.betterticket.info/a-2021-full-comparison-of-blockchain-event-ticketing-platform-543fb525b6b7"" >dozens of startups</a> are pursuing NFT ticketing solutions, whilst numerous venues are using the technology already, from Real Madrid FC and UEFA, to the NBA and NFL.   ""It is a marathon, not a sprint.""    Maarten Bloemers, CEO of the GET Protocol Foundation  ""The main bottleneck we see in the ticketing industry itself is those within it who oppose innovation and try to keep things as is  either from greed or complacency. We are not worried about these types however, as we are fully aware it is a marathon, not a sprint, and we are in it for the long haul,"" Maarten Bloemers, CEO of the GET Protocol Foundation, tells Culture3.  Founded in 2016, the foundation supports the development of <a href=""https://www.get-protocol.io"" >GET Protocol</a>, a digital ticketing infrastructure built on the Polygon network, an Ethereum sidechain. Over 2 million tickets for almost 12,000 events have been processed on the platform to date, a quarter of which were sold in the first three months of 2022, according to <a href=""https://explorer.get-protocol.io"" >onchain data</a>.  Ticketing is an industry with glaring problems, and the existing blockchain tech stack is already being used to resolve many of them. The core innovation of blockchain technology is the potential for verifiably unique assets, which prevents counterfeiting. Meanwhile, smart contract technology allows the original ticket resellers to embed price limits on the price of their tickets, and the storage of transaction records on the blockchain makes all transactions, from issuance to resale to invalidation, a smooth and transparent process.   ""NFT tickets eliminate these issues entirely.""    Josh Katz, CEO of Yellow Heart   Plus, the ability to track tickets enables moving QR codes, which means you can't just screenshot a ticket and get to the venue before the legitimate ticket holder. For example, UEFA used NFT tickets for Euro 2020, the European international football championship, which activated only when ticket holders got close to the relevant stadium.  ""In the past, if tickets to a show sold out quickly, fans would either miss out or pay for a ticket at a much higher price point. Even worse, many tickets are resold as counterfeits, which means fans pay more, and still don't get to see the show. NFT tickets eliminate these issues entirely. They put the control back in the hands of artists and fans, ensuring that fans won't get ripped off or stuck with a counterfeit ticket,"" says Josh Katz, founder and CEO of <a href=""https://yh.io"" >YellowHeart</a>. YellowHeart is an NFT marketplace for ticketing, music, and community tokens. Kings of Leon released <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toifccc1nr4"" >18 NFT tickets</a> through the marketplace in March, which provides access to front-row concert tickets at every tour the band does, for life. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1339px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1339px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62b4f1fe35b312ed29686676_katz.png"" loading=""lazy"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" > <figcaption > Josh Katz, founder of YellowHeart, an NFT ticketing marketplace, expects all tickets to be NFTs within a decade. ""As we reimagine how tickets are sold and distributed, the possibilities are endless."" </figcaption></figure> But initial ticket sale is only one part of the process. The secondary ticket sale market is <a href=""https://brandessenceresearch.com/requestsample/postid/1610"" >projected to reach</a> $9.7 billion by 2027, according to market research firm Brand Essence. Maarten explains that""our tickets are fully traceable onchain, meaning that fans can see not only the validity of their tickets, but also the price previously paid for it and whether it's been checked in."" GET has built a ticket explorer with <a href=""https://explorer.get-protocol.io"" >live ticket data</a>, a purpose-built explorer similar to general blockchain explorers like EtherScan for Ethereum or TzStats for Tezos.  Meanwhile, for diehard fans and those with a penchant for memorabilia, tickets have never been just vehicles purely of transactional value. Wearing festival wristbands and keeping a corkboard with concert ticket stubs point to the greater value that committed fans attach to what others see as just pieces of paper. NFTs, which replace the paper, help leverage this aspect.   ""At this pace, all tickets will be NFTs within the next 5-10 years.""    Josh Katz, CEO of Yellow Heart   Consider Heroes Den Bosch. When the Dutch basketball team beat their rivals in a key semi-final with a last minute dunk, fans across the country had experienced an iconic image, but only the actual attendees, verified by their NFT tickets, could show undeniable proof that they were there: an NFT of the moment <a href=""https://explorer.get-protocol.io/ticket/1095794"" >airdropped exclusively to the wallets</a> of attendees (the wallet associated with their original ticket). Seasoned NFT collectors and traders will be familiar with the model: NBA Top Shot is a licensed NBA project of short clips as NFTs, built on the Flow blockchain by Dapper Labs. Examples abound of sports teams pursuing this model of ticket-enabled memorabilia' in order to provide extra value to fans.  Further, the interplay between decentralised finance (DeFi) and NFTs unlocks a broader set of opportunities. Financing events using funds raised by existing ticket sales is common, whilst NFT creators can use protocols like <a href=""https://www.get-protocol.io/event-financing"" >GET Protocol</a> to pre-fund their own events by collateralising  future  ticket sales. Big names are already paying attention. In May, ticketing company XTIXS and GET Protocol <a href=""https://www.theticketingbusiness.com/2022/05/31/xtixs-announces-defi-funded-event-in-partnership-with-get-protocol/"" >launched a DeFi-funded event</a> for singer Lewis Capaldi's August 23rd concert in the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:4096px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""4096px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62bb0884f9744048a9a7b2ee_crop.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Heroes Den Bosch, a Dutch basketball team, are using NFT tickets to drive greater engagement with their fans. </figcaption></figure> The event reached its funding target in fewer than 24 hours, Maarten explains.""What the liquidity providers are buying are batches of NFT tickets, the value of which they will recoup once the primary sale takes place,"" he explained. In this experimental case, the liquidity was provided by people from around GET's network,""to ensure that the flow works and our smart contracts are behaving as they should."" But the product will gradually become available to users anywhere in the world.  Leveraging ticket sales, potential or realised, as collateral is not a use case that necessarily requires NFTs or decentralised finance, but both methods can add value. When it comes to NFTs, the use of the underlying smart contract technology delegates enforcing the contract to mutually agreed code, removing the requirement to go through other lengthier procedures if tickets do not sell as expected, and thus removing some of the risks.  Meanwhile, the contribution of  decentralised  finance adds value too: by broadening the scope of financing opportunities, more creators have the ability to launch events and build their career, whilst it is a new way for groups of people to unite around a market hypothesis or group of creators to make a return or build an agency.  With novel financing models pushing boundaries, web3 clearly poses new challenges for policymakers, particularly when decentralised finance presents new investment opportunities and risks. But when it comes to the core NFT ticketing issue, the technology solves a problem that policymakers have run out of solutions for. Indeed, <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/Brilliant-Economy898"">Brilliant-Economy898</a>, the pseudonymous admin behind the Reddit subreddit r/NFTTickets, an online community of NFT ticketing enthusiasts, believes that NFT tickets will make compliance with legislation even easier. ""We see more and more that legislation aims to kill scalping and fraud, but they fail to execute as they have no tools: blockchain-based open protocols could solve this,"" they argued.""Translate the legislation into smart contracts and impose the rules that way, by demanding such a protocol is used by anybody who wants to sell tickets, like some sort of a license.""  NFT technology itself goes a long way beyond the JPEGs that currently make up the lion's share of the market. Josh argues that""with how quickly technology, as well as artists and fans, have caught up to the general concept and benefits of NFT tickets, I don't see the momentum slowing down. As we reimagine how tickets are sold and distributed, the possibilities are endless."" Indeed, Josh expects this momentum to accelerate.""At this pace, all tickets will be NFTs within the next 5-10 years."" Maybe it will take a little longer than that, but the use case is clear. Grab your tickets, this one will go the distance. ",3122

Bursting with vibrant colour and filling up a dazzling set of video displays, the artist's love letter to Africa's musical traditions was a must-see for the city's foot traffic.  Presented by W1 Curates on the side of Flannels' flagship store,  JigSaw Tribe  is part of Nissi's ongoing <a href=""https://www.w1curates.com/posts/nissi-ogulu""> Puzzle </a> project, an exploration of history and culture that combines music, art, web3, and on-the-ground action.""I wanted to showcase African heritage and the musicality that comes behind it,"" she says,""but in a very contemporary, hyper-futuristic style.""   Of course, the future is where Nissi thrives; not sitting back and speculating about it, but actively creating it. As a visual artist, animator, musician  and a chartered engineer  she has worked on everything from award-winning short films to designing sustainable vehicles for the Red Cross.""I think it all comes from the same creative space,"" she says.""Of course, it's a different interpretation of that energy: I would interpret music in a different way to how I interpret my fine art, or my product design, but they all do come from the same source.""  ""I wanted to showcase African heritage and the musicality that comes behind it.""    Nissi Ogulu   Though she herself hails from Port Harcourt, Nigeria, Nissi draws inspiration from musical instruments spanning the entire African continent for  JigSaw Tribe . Each image in the <a href=""https://www.binance.com/en/nft/collection/jigsaw-tribe-580693868115951617"">collection</a> is stylised as a puzzle piece, part of a larger image of the continent's creative history. Amongst them features West Africa's gan gan, or talking drum', whose stocky hourglass shape is one of the most universally recognisable African instruments. From the East, Nissi focuses on Griots, storytellers who use a range of instrument to mimic the sound of a town crier:""it's the sound that will wake people up in the morning,"" she laughs.  From North Africa, she was inspired by the horns of the Hamar tribe which are""made from the horns of animals, and form part of the celebration when a child comes of age."" And, from the South, comes the Mouth Bow, an instrument derived from the bows and arrows used by hunting parties.""These hunters were also innate musicians,"" says Nissi.""They started to use their mouth to hit on the string of the bow to formulate sounds and make music."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3571px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3571px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/631205080d093983e6ce23ee_no3.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Nissi Ogulu's art and music celebrate African culture with a global audience. </figcaption></figure> Fittingly, there is music composed for each image in  JigSaw Tribe .""In the exhibition,"" she explains,""there was a barcode right next to each piece. You could scan it with your phone to hear the sound of the instrument."" While the first NFT iteration of  JigSaw Tribe  was purely visual, Nissi says that she is planning to keep developing the project to bring the music of these instruments to the digital space as well.  Spotlighting these instruments through Nissi's distinctive contemporary style is not only an act of celebration and preservation, but also a practical way to raise funds for the challenges that many Africans are facing right now. Partnering with <a href=""https://www.binance.charity/"">Binance Charity</a>, proceeds from the  JigSaw Tribe  collection help fund <a href=""https://thereach.ng/""> The Reach </a>, a charity set up by Nissi's family in the wake of Covid-19 to support the most vulnerable in local Nigerian communities. ""We provide food aid in southern Nigeria,"" says Nissi.""We started during the pandemic; we were seeing a lot of people struggling to go about their daily lives. In certain regions in Nigeria, a majority of people live on what they make in the day; that's your daily bread, that's what you survive on.

She says her grandfather was the one who""championed"" her development as a recording artist after she played him a demo that she had recorded when she was thirteen.""He really taught me about the intricacies of music,"" she recalls.""He introduced me to the world of jazz and blues. I spent a lot of time listening to Nina Knaack Simone and Tracy Chapman.""  One of the central lessons Nissi says her grandfather impressed upon her was the importance of expressing emotions through song. It is something that she still relies on to this day in her songwriting process:""If I'm getting sent beats, I don't want to hear them until I'm in the studio  otherwise, it's not going to be organic.""   Her most recent single, Gravity, saw her collaborate with rising stars of South Africa's Amapiano genre, the musical ensemble Major league DJz.""I love those guys,"" she effuses,""I was in the studio and the beat for Gravity came on, and I just immediately started to freestyle on it. The song was made the same day.""  Hinting at a future EP, Nissi says her focus will be more introspective.""For me, inspiration usually comes from other people, but if you take a step of extreme vulnerability in your music, it's very powerful. That's where I will draw inspiration from on my next project.""  Nissi is no stranger to exploring tough issues through music.

While a lot of web3 leaders are currently clustered in America and the West, Nissi says she already sees a large and growing interest in the space coming <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/zain-verjee"">from the African continent</a>.""I find that there is an immense amount of creativity in the continent,"" says Nissi.""Obviously, more still needs to be done to spread the word, but within creative communities, people always have their eyes and ears glued on to the latest innovations, so they are definitely in tune with web3 and the NFT space.""  In a poignant way, by channelling the spirit of Africa's oldest musical inventions through digital art and NFTs, she acts as a link in an unbroken chain of innovation; a new piece in a puzzle that stretches back to pre-history. Just as those ancient musicians and instrument makers left a legacy for Nissi to find, she too looks ahead to her own future legacy.""You need to be sure that you're actually making an impact on the world, because at the end of the day, the most important thing about being alive is what inspiration you leave for others, for those who come after you.""

The digital follows up on the analogue, but can also be a source of inspiration by itself. In conversation with Nina Knaack Knaack, she discusses her artistic journey and how making NFTs gave her the recognition and freedom that she had been searching for throughout her career.",Wed Aug 24 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Sculpture-Art; Digital-Art,Nina Knaack,"  This piece was originally published on Nina Knaack Knaack's personal  <a href=""https://www.Nina Knaackknaack.com/artists-stories/noortje-stortelder"" > website </a> .   After a brief stint in commercial design, Noortje studied at the Willem de Kooning Academy in Rotterdam from 2006 to 2010. She initially focused on lifestyle and design, but quickly found that making autonomous art suited her better.""My work was not at all made with a selling point of view. I was not commercial enough,"" she explains.  Three years of artistic research and practice followed, with graduating as a sculptor being the result.""Back then I actually only made sculptures, and not digital art. I loved working with my hands and learning more about specific crafts. Together with my artistic partner I made big physical 3D works out of latex and rubber.""  After graduating as an artist, Noortje decided to pursue further study.""This time something where you really had to learn from books. I felt like I needed that, as if that was actually studying' and art school didn't count. But soon after starting the sociology degree I noticed that I couldn't live without creating. That's when I knew that my destiny was to make things, all the time.""   ""My work was not at all made with a selling point of view. I was not commercial enough.""    Noortje Stortelder   However, making enormous installations and sculptures is not easy if you do not have the space and the materials at hand.""I was quite short on money, but felt that I had to make things somehow. I started making 2D works. I had my laptop and I had Photoshop on it, so that's the medium I decided to use. In the beginning this resulted in very raw collages. I stole photos from the internet and used them as parts of my assemblages. ""Of course I knew that wasn't really correct, but I sort of felt rebellious towards the internet culture. Everybody was just putting everything out there and I felt a need to then use it to make something new. Eventually, I did research on when you were allowed to reuse other people's images; when you totally reform them to an extent that they're not recognisable anymore, it's alright."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:750px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""750px""> <img alt=""Afstudeer werk_N.Stortelder_1.JPG"" src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6306436bb58609ef70a7ad60_Afstudeer%2Bwerk_N.Stortelder_1.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Noortje's final piece at art school. </figcaption></figure> Even though the medium through which Noortje began to work was very different from what she was used to, the working process felt the same.""Sculpturing consists of working with layers of clay and other materials, constantly building new pieces on each other. I would also make prints of body parts, paste that on the physical sculpture and then make new molds and forms of that again. In Photoshop you actually do exactly the same: add on, redesign, reprint, cut, paste; again and again. It all felt very familiar and it also felt really good to be in the process of making something again.""  From that moment onwards, Noortje started to produce a lot of art in a range of mediums.""Besides making my own digital collages, I also worked a lot with musicians and dancers, making their video clips or posters for performances.""The dancers gave me a lot of new inspiration with regard to working with the human body as a starting point. They showed me how you can use a body and all its parts. Music can be another great inspiration for me, especially with regards to the emotions I feel and trying to capture those feelings in my artwork."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:750px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""750px""> <img alt=""Voyeurism is participation_N.Stortelder.jpg"" src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6306436b381c064624729109_Voyeurism%2Bis%2Bparticipation_N.Stortelder.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > One of Noortje's early 2D works, 'Pleasant to be alive'. </figcaption></figure> Noortje's biggest artistic influences come from Auguste Rodin and Hans Bellmer.""Overall you can say that my work is always about transformation: the transitions between humans and nature and their unique structures. Body language is fascinating to me. Your posture is an underestimated form of communication. They present you something without words and there are a lot of emotions involved. I once had a very vivid dream about human bodies and I've been trying to visualise that in my work ever since.""   Nature is another early source of inspiration, due to the fact that her parents always took the family out to the forest and framed what they were seeing all around them.""Also, the older I get, the bigger small things become for me. One leaf can now be such a magnificent thing for me to experience, whereas before I would probably have focused on the tree as a whole.""  Her 2D works were part of several exhibitions over time, printed and framed. Sometimes Noortje would sell a print but she always kept feeling that this is not it yet'.""I had to work in bars at night to make my living. In the mornings I would then create. I was quite frustrated about this from time to time but the urge to make things still stayed. So I kept on going.""  Then the big Beeple sale <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/beeple-nft-auction-closes-at-record-setting-69-3m"">happened</a>. Noortje was deluged with texts all asking the same question: should she not do something with NFTs? She had briefly heard about crypto art through another platform, but had not learnt much about the space so far.""Since multiple friends drew my attention to it, I decided to research it. 'What do I have to lose?' I thought to myself."" She created a wallet on the Ethereum blockchain and started putting art on OpenSea. She minted a series from 2017, called  Bugs  (now  Crypto Bugs ), and started a Twitter account. After a month or so, Noortje reacted to a tweet by a dark art' profile that asked Show me your Dark Art'. Noortje posted her work and soon after got a message from a collector who was very interested in her work.""He then pretty much immediately bought it and, for the first time, I felt the recognition I had missed all these years."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63064e845aed42af023184c1_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(9).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/70122655157528073404063784529805304367220900593845472733067514776208134897665""> Butterfly </a> , by Noortje Stortelder. </figcaption></figure> After that, Noortje was motivated to learn more and work more in web3.

She also began minting on Tezos.""Sometimes I make these quick and raw images/collages that might feel slightly unfinished but are actually quite interesting visuals. Those I drop on Tezos and this gives me great freedom. Other works that have a long making process or are part of a bigger collection I put on Ethereum.""   ""I have never felt so strongly about my art as now, since it gets worldly recognition. This is what I was looking for.""    Noortje Stortelder   But whichever blockchain she uses, Noortje feels like she found her crew'.""When I started minting NFTs, it suddenly all clicked for me. There are people out there that are actually interested in my work. They like it and they also want to pay for it. I guess I always felt that I didn't really belong in the Dutch, traditional art world. My work has a touch of fantasy and that doesn't really have a place here or in the big museums.

I love to use the blockchain technique as a new medium. It gives you so many different possibilities. For example working with different layers and minting different versions of a work.""  Noortje also sees making NFTs as a way to overlay her physical work. For example, if she creates a sculpture, she then fragments certain elements from it to reshape it in a digital art piece. Crypto art and physical art are therefore intrinsically related;""they complement each other.""  Bear market or not, Noortje has confidence in the web3 and NFT communities.""I think that this time is perfect to create a lot of new work. As long as you stay active on Twitter and Discord, I think you'll get there with the community that you built and are still building.

With sell-out collections and millions of listeners on Spotify, they are pioneering new models of music ownership and are the closest that web3 music has come to going mainstream.

Since the release of their genesis collection earlier this year, they've been in the vanguard of web3's generative music scene  their collections sell out in minutes, they've garnered over 1.7 million monthly listeners on Spotify, and pioneered entirely new models of music distribution and ownership. Now, they're pursuing perhaps the most ambitious generative project web3 has seen to date, seeking to transform the cultural understanding of what it means to make music.   With a staggering 5,550 unique, full-length songs, and accompanying anime Studio Ghibli animations by the renowned Werlan Meyer studio, this new release already stands in a league of its own, but omgkirby isn't relying on simple scale to dazzle us  they've also got heavyweight talent in their corner. Known worldwide for his breakout single, Top Down, <a href=""https://twitter.com/channel_tres"">Channel Tres</a> has emerged as one of music's true auteurs, capable of distilling genres down to their essence and combining the results into something all his own. Working with the LA-based rapper-producer""was amazing,"" says omgkirby over email.""We love to mix and blend genres just like he does, so we had a lot of fun building this collection."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3840px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3840px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/632c9ec22d0d2fc262df477b_Narrative%20Image%203.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > The omgkirby x Channel Tres artwork was created by Werlan Meyer studio. Each second of animation has 25 hand-drawn frames. </figcaption></figure> Having previously worked with the likes of Tyler the Creator and TOKiMONSTA, Channel Tres is no stranger to collaboration, and though this will be the his first foray into web3, omgkirby says there was no friction adapting his style into a generative format.""Everyone was on the same page and excited every step of the way,"" they said.""Channel and his team really trusted us with the vision we had for this project.""  Part of what makes this collection so exciting is how rare, relatively speaking, the artform of generative music still is. In comparison to the NFT art world, which has seen many successful generative collections, the majority of web3 music still features the same static audio you'll get on web2 streaming platforms; generative musicians like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/deafbeef"">DEAFBEEF</a> are so uncommon as to be almost forgotten by those who aren't highly familiar with his work. This is something that omgkirby is intent on changing. ""Music in web3 should sound different,"" they argue.""Just as all these other things being built in web3 should advance and be different as well, we're looking to break the barrier on what's possible with music creation.""  The omgkirby X Channel Tres collection certainly goes some way to breaking that barrier. For each of the 5,550 music NFTs, there is a unique combination of musical elements. The beats per minute, the key, and the arrangement  intro, outro, chorus  are all algorithmically generated, and months of trial and error was spent tweaking the code to ensure that each song could stand on its own, while still bearing the musical imprint of the collaborating artists. As they raise the bar for generative music NFTs, omgkirby is simultaneously helping to establish a radically new conception of selling them.  Continuing an approach omgkirby pioneered with their 3k genesis, any fan who purchases a song from the collection will own it  completely. In a deal that would put web2 music executives into a cold sweat, omgkirby and Channel Tres transfer full sound recording and publishing rights to the NFT holder at point of purchase: the purchaser can listen to it, resell it, remix it, use it in their own projects, or even upload it to streaming platforms and profit from the royalties. Venture capital firm Castle Island Ventures used their omgkirby genesis as intro and outro music for their <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/show/47aw3C5brBfL8pCIw8LrQL"">On The Brink</a> podcast, while Jaden Smith used one he owned to create his own song.  Underpinning all of this is the omgkirby DAO  a community of fans and fellow music-makers originally comprising genesis holders who collectively operate as a decentralised music label. Members have voting rights, influence the direction of future projects, and often have the chance to give real time feedback on songs as they're being written.   ""We're looking to break the barrier on what's possible with music creation.""    omgkirby    Their large-scale collections, says omgkirby, are a way to further their artistic vision in web3 while also helping to fund the DAO and support its goal of developing a""community of music enthusiasts who can build new music projects."" It's classic web3: a community-led music project using their profits to collectively invest in new talent and help members get their careers off the ground. ""It's revolutionary,"" effuses omgkirby.""Web3 allows artists to create a direct to fan relationship, and to reward that fan."" This direct to fan engagement model, they say, can be as simple as digital collectibles or as ambitious as the full transfer of music rights  ultimately allowing fans to organically create a universe of music that exists across new derivatives and mediums. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3840px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3840px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/632c9f9175e6fa15631a873a_Narrative%20Image%204.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Omgkirby is known only by their pseudonym.""We wanted to create music that gave people comfort and not have to worry about who or what the musician is."" </figcaption></figure> In an industry that has historically centred on personal celebrity and beauty worship, the clear success of an anonymous, decentralised, music artist is heartening. Fans of omgkirby don't know what they look like, their backstory, or the intimate details of their personal life  and yet, the emotional connection between the music and the community is no less strong for any of that. If anything, it might be stronger. ""I get hundreds of DMs every week from fans expressing how much we and the music means to them,"" they reveal.""It was always about putting the music first and removing ego. We wanted to create music that gave people comfort and not have to worry about who or what the musician is. It allows people to get lost in the music and use their own imagination in the world we are building."" ",1965

Over a decade on from the anonymous Warhol tributes he stencilled across Los Angeles, that his works should find themselves on display alongside those of the Pop Art pioneer is as much a testament to the artist's own personal progression as it is to the fine art world's <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/70-million-in-art-at-moma-to-be-sold-to-extend-museums-digital-reach-11663117201"">increasing recognition</a> of the digital talent blossoming on the blockchain.  One of the first artists to bring fine art to the blockchain, ThankYouX has played a pivotal role in beating a path for the traditional art world in the depths of web3.

His journey to this point, however, has been far from conventional.  ThankYouX's passion for painting first took hold during illicit late-night graffiti sessions in his local neighbourhood as a teen.""My mom would drive past something and be like, wait, that's something you've written before. Did you do that?' And I got in trouble!"" Years later, inspired by LA's rich street art scene whilst working as a graphic designer, he channelled his creative frustrations into his now-famous stencilled Warhol tributes.""I was fascinated with, to be honest, the anarchy of everything,"" he admits.""What made me the happiest was when I was out in the streets at two in the morning, putting up art and seeing other art that maybe was going to be gone the next day."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" style=""max-width:80%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width=""80%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63efb8a6c4ba0470e4280ef9_Screenshot%202023-02-17%20at%2017.25.30.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >  ""I love artists making money. I would rather have artists making money than Wall Street."" Photo courtesy of Lindsey Byrnes. </figcaption></figure> From the ephemeral world of hastily-stencilled street art to fine artworks minted on-chain, echoes of this anarchist spirit reverberate across ThankYouX's story. They appear through his non-conformist attitude and an ethos that prioritises authenticity and mutual support from the grassroots.  It was this search for authenticity that led ThankYouX to move away from the Warhol tributes that had initially put him on the map. By 2010, he had already gained international recognition for his murals and colourful cube designs. As early as 2017 he was exploring ways to bring his art to the blockchain. Among those interested in collaborating was Snoop Dogg. At that time, it wasn't to be.""It just fizzled because we didn't have the tech side in place,"" ThankYouX reflects.   ""I was fascinated with, to be honest, the anarchy of everything,""    ThankYouX   Fast forward to 2020 and a United States navigating a global pandemic. An outdoor fundraiser for New York's Museum of Art and Design, to which ThankYouX had contributed art, set the stage for a fortuitous meeting with DJ and music producer, 3LAU. As 3LAU enthused about NFTs and their significance for artists, ThankYouX began to connect the dots once again.  ""I started paying attention more and more, looking at Nifty Gateway, SuperRare, and all the early websites. I didn't see any art that looked like what I already did,"" he says. He saw the challenge as an invitation.""When you are interested in something and you see nothing like what you do, it's either very scary or very exciting because you' re either going to stand out or fail.""  Deciding that it was better to""fail together"", ThankYouX's first venture onto the blockchain was a mixed media collaboration with the Miami-based artist, JN Silva. Blending street photography with fine art  at a time when neither existed on the blockchain , Thank You New York was released on Nifty Gateway in <a href=""https://www.niftygateway.com/collections/thankyouxsilva"">December 2020</a> to instant acclaim.""The money was cool,"" ThankYouX reflects on our call, adding,""but it was really about the excitement that we got from doing it."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" style=""max-width:80%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width=""80%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63efb2dfb1204c5bfed06995_ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://www.niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x3a44aad55a70412b189f46852499ace9ec0d6de6/1"" > Times Squares </a> , by ThankYouX and JN Silva, was the Angeleno's first foray into NFTs. </figcaption></figure> Rather than keeping a hold of this newfound excitement for himself, ThankYouX channeled it into the nascent NFT art scene. He hosted spaces on Clubhouse alongside Lady Phoenix and other early advocates, providing an early platform for artists like Fewocious.""A lot of people were looking at what we did, so it was like, let's take that attention and put it on these other artists that we see have releases coming out.'""  These days, hosting a pre-launch Twitter Space is almost a rite of passage for any NFT project. Its origins trace back to those impromptu gatherings on Clubhouse:""that format created purely organically from what we were doing"", as ThankYouX puts it. By February 2021, collectors were catching on, initiating a heady period of explosive growth for many of the artists that have gone on to become major names within the NFT scene.""I would host a room and then the artists speaking would sell millions of dollars' worth of artwork that same day. It was just very surreal to be like, oh my God, I can't believe I was part of that history right there'.""  Despite the massive financial success that has accompanied the rise of NFT artists such as 3LAU and Beeple, ThankYouX has strong opinions against the portrayal of web3 as a kind of get-rich-quick-scheme.""I love artists making money. I would rather have artists making money than Wall Street. But it's not a magical fairyland where you kind of come up and it's, oh, now you' re in web3, you're going to buy a Lamborghini'.""  Indeed, ThankYouX is clear about the hard work and dedication it takes to succeed in NFTs.""If you're here to make art, you probably should have already been making art somewhere else before this space happened. If the idea is that you're going to start making art now because there's a financial element to it, then you're probably not going to do it from an authentic place.""   For ThankYouX, this authenticity is rooted in the way his works form a dialogue with the material world.""By starting in the physical, it's the most authentically me. Everything comes from the concept."" From the animations of his signature cubes embedded within <a href=""https://www.niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0xdc89669bb478506078ea5c1644bbb09e072474e7/6"">Cy Twombly-influenced paintings</a>, to the triptych, <a href=""https://www.bonhams.com/press_release/34663"" target=""_blank""> Holding On </a>, which explores themes of time and memory through the creative depictions of a truck in contrasting states of restoration, destruction and reimagination, the artist succeeds in destabilising preconceived notions of the divide between the physical and the digital.  Whereas new genre-bending terminology is often used to describe ThankYouX's works, it all fundamentally comes down to one thing for the artist himself: art.""I never use the term phygital', ThankYouX tells me.""Is my painting now a digital art piece because there's a screen inside it? Or is it a physical now that there's a screen? It could be both. Or is it neither?""  Besides his own unique approach to art, ThankYouX looks to the ways in which his contemporaries are pushing boundaries on the blockchain.""In the future, in history books for art, there'll be Picasso, Fewocious, Warhol. It won't be, here are these artists, and then, here are the digital artists.'"" His tone shifts from mock derision to a defiant firmness,""it's going to be all on the same page for the people who really rise up.""   ""In web2, creatives have been pitted against each other.""    ThankYouX   Beyond blockchain-inspired innovations in form and content, web3 is changing the very conditions in which artists create. ThankYouX sees this transformation driven by a level of accessibility and opportunity that wasn't available within the centralised models of traditional art. Describing the barriers to entry upheld by art galleries as""full gatekeeper mode,"" web3 reminds him of more""anarchic"" times.""Here, it's like the way that street art is. You can go and be like, well, fuck SuperRare, I'm going to put work up on OpenSea. Fuck Nifty Gateway, I can go make my own contract and put it up wherever, any time of the day'.""  Similarly, web3 is facilitating a level of collaboration between artists that didn't make sense before; with web2, it just couldn't. Prior to his discovery of NFTs, ThankYouX notes that many of the biggest names in the space""had already been following each other for a long time, like the Fvckrenders and <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/slimesunday"">Slimesunday</a>. Filip Hodas and I were DMing for years."" Wryly, he adds""we were always saying, oh, what if we did a collab and put it on Instagram and got some likes for it'."" Today, that seems quaint: web3 lets artists collaborate so much more effectively.  The creative dead-end of Facebook and Instagram contrasts with the cross-pollination of expertise that ThankYouX describes within the NFT community, as painters demonstrate techniques to sculptors and 3D visual artists skill-share with musicians. Taking calls with colleagues and aspiring artists whenever he can, ThankYouX is generous with the advice and the support he offers others. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2386px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2386px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/632352b9af25470e6c188d29_THANKYOUX-STARTING%20SOMEWHERE%20(1).jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://www.bonhams.com/auction/27758/lot/24/thankyoux-starting-somewhere-2022/"" > Starting Somewhere </a> , by ThankYouX. </figcaption></figure> He is adamant that the level of cooperation he sees within the NFT space is unique to web3.""Could you imagine Billy Eilish, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, and Rihanna in a group text and they're like, hey guys, my album's coming out next week, can you all retweet?' They'd be like, no, bitch, I have an album coming out next week too.' In web2, creatives have been pitted against each other because there are only so many slots that they can fit in. And so they're all fighting for those slots.""   ""That's what I love about the web3 space, that there's an endless amount of slots. We're just like, cool, you're in that slot. I'm right next to you in this slot. And you're over here in this slot and like maybe we can share this slot together'.""  Just as Basquiat and Haring took inspiration from Warhol, together forming the vanguard of the iconic Pop Art movement, artists within web3 are defying convention to collectively lay the groundwork for a new generation-defining moment in art history.""That's how movements rise,"" ThankYouX observes.""It's not just a few people. We can all rise together."" ",3465
"Digital product designer by day, organic 3D artist by night  the story of Anthony Kyriazis",onyro,Wed Nov 09 2022 20:39:12,"Anthony Kyriazis always knew he was different. But it was only when he realised that this was a good thing that he could play a Lea Rose Emeryding role in shaping the 3D digital abstract art movement. He speaks to Nina Knaack Knaack about balancing work and passion, using art as a self-exploratory tool, and how he is using NFTs""to create a heritage for my children.""",Mon Nov 14 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,3d-Art; Motion-Graphics; Uk; Europe,Nina Knaack," Anthony's love for design and art began when at school.""I loved drawing and would get lost in my own imagination. I was not just replicating things and had a very intuitive approach instead."" However, Anthony felt like he did not really  excel .""I enjoyed it, but had this notion of not being good enough, since I did not stick to the common style."" Nonetheless, the urge to draw stayed. Over time, he came to see his instinct to give his creations a unique signature as a strength rather than a weakness.""It took me a while to understand that being different is actually a good thing in many ways.""   Known by his name Onyro, his artwork is characteristic for its moving imagery. Dreamlike and almost in a state of trance, his pieces often contain living organisms floating in perfect harmony and moving at great ease.""My love for organic objects and environments comes from ambient, electronic music and their artwork, like the cover of the  Cascade  single (1993) by The Future Sound Of London. That visual accompaniment showed me that there were other people out there with the same imagination as me. I also vividly remember watching  The Abyss  (1989) and loving all the liquid morphing effects in the movie. These things made me want to learn how to create in 3D myself.""  Onyro's road was not the artistic route, however. After school he studied multimedia design, with a special focus on interaction design for the early internet. Curious and eager to explore, he was always experimenting with the newest technologies.""There was a lab at university with a few Silicon Graphics machines (an advanced visual workstation in the 1990s). I would secretly sneak in the room to teach myself how to work with these programmes. Of course, back then in the nineties there were no video tutorials or anything, so you had to figure it out by yourself.""  His career as a Flash Web Designer soon took off, landing him multiple industry awards. But the real work happened at night, working on his biggest passion: making abstracts and motions.""Throughout my career I had never considered myself an artist. A designer, yes, but making art just felt like a hobby. Creating it was always an escape. Something I did for me, to push myself and try to do things nobody else did."" At this time, Onyro's design career was accelerating further. He founded his own digital agency and ran creative departments for a range of advertising agencies. Having also just started his family, this left little time for his own artistic work. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63723c844ca07b0f62ac79d5_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(7).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/fazmaticca-38208"" target=""_blank""> fazmaticca </a> , by Onyro </figcaption></figure> That all changed when he discovered Houdini, a 3D artistry tool.""I had seen a lot of art on Instagram that I liked and noticed the creators constantly referenced Houdini as being the programme they used. I got myself a copy and started experimenting and creating.""  His time working with Houdini made him realise how much he had missed making art. So far, however, he had done little with his creations beyond making them for himself, as a way to process life. Whilst he was familiar with blockchain technologies  "" he had previously mined Ethereum (when it was a proof-of-work chain) to earn some extra money  "" but he did not know much about NFTs, which he only began to explore when the energy cost of mining became too high.  It suddenly clicked that minting his own NFTs could be his form of mining. And a better one,""because now I could create something everlasting if I used the blockchain from the creator's perspective."" Anthony's main driving forces were his boys.""After researching web3 I understood that NFTs gave me the opportunity to create a heritage for my children. Something I could pass on, a timeline for them to be able to see how their father evolved, how he expressed himself, and how he learnt his way through life.""  Onyro's art forms a catalogue of the emotional journey he has experienced throughout his life.""When I got a divorce, I was going through a very reflective time; my works are about how I found my way through it. I learnt how to develop new exchanges with others after really getting to know myself with the help of therapy, and that journey is portrayed in my art.""  In that respect, Anthony's work is very much about the exploration of self.""I now know what the journey of inner contemplation is and how that is needed to cultivate and maintain relationships. It is necessary to know oneself, to be able to communicate clearly, to fight for something you want, and to enable negotiation. To not be afraid of expressing your deepest feelings, to find love and feel loved without being afraid to show the real version of you.""   ""NFTs gave me the opportunity to create a heritage for my children.""    Onyro   Anthony's art is exactly portraying these ideas of learning and observing in a meta way. In his work there is always something growing or pulsating, giving the observer a peaceful feeling.""By developing knowledge of yourself you learn to attract what is good for you. When there is a transfer of the same energy you can feel the harmony within. I try to express the beauty of this balance in my own abstract way."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:800px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""800px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63723ca8fd512d6b9c05ac11_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(12).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/plasmasophica-39765""> plasmasophica </a> , by Onyro. </figcaption></figure> Anthony calls the imaginary worlds he creates organica', which is also the name of his genesis <a href=""https://knownorigin.io/gallery/256800-organica"">piece</a>, whilst the word Onyro' (derived from Oneiro) refers to dream' in Greek.""In my dreamy cosmos I want people to connect with themselves, to feel calm and relaxed.

The idea that his subconscious spheres are minted on the blockchain and have the provenance and potential to live forever, is deeply meaningful for Anthony.""My art is a timeless record of my emotional state during a certain period of time. I do hope that my work can offer hope and strength, in the same way it gave me a reason to push forward and keep on evolving.""  Onyro feels strongly that he has grown as an individual because of his art.""More than my design career, my art is the real investment I make in me. It's showing me the paths I can take in becoming a better version of myself.

Opening the door to an NFT community super-app,op3n,Wed Nov 23 2022 18:26:31,Can bundling everything NFT creators need into a single app help make mainstream adoption a reality? Op3n wants to make it easy for anyone to create an engaging community in web3. Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg explores what it might look like.,Mon Nov 21 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Nft; Communities; Platforms,Randy Ginsburg," As with many disruptive technologies, the excitement around innovation often outshines the readiness for mainstream adoption. With NFTs, the situation is even more complex. In many respects, web3 technologies are  ready enough  for the wider world. NBA Top Shot, Reddit, or Ticketmaster's millions of NFT tickets is a testament to that. But to go mainstream, it is not enough for major companies to make web3 accessible; independent creators must be able to do so as well.  As the classic marketing mantra goes,""people don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole."" The concept is already being applied in web3 by industry leaders. Dapper Labs, the company behind the <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/flow"">Flow</a> blockchain which powers NBA Top Shot and Ticketmaster's NFT technology, is widely seen as the leading force behind mainstream adoption. In an interview with <a href=""https://www.actionnetwork.com/news/nba-top-shot-ceo-concerns-digital-card-company-2021"">the Action Network</a>, CEO Roham Gharegozlou explains that it is often best to forego the technical jargon altogether when aiming for accessibility and non-crypto consumers. ""I try not to talk about the blockchain part,"" Gharegozlou said.""To be good at <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/gamechangers-what-web3-offers-sports-lovers-teams-and-innovators"">NBA Top Shot</a>, you don't need to understand anything about crypto. Most of our users come in as credit card users. They aren't cryptocurrency users and that's what we like about it.""  That approach is critical. Companies like MoonPay have found success as fiat on-ramps which let users buy NFTs and cryptocurrencies with their existing cards  no wallet needed. Prioritising accessibility, Reddit has <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/ux-first-seed-phrase-second-reddits-nft-success"">onboarded millions</a> of NFT sceptics simply by rebranding their onchain avatars as Digital Collectibles'. Like Topshot, Reddit took a similar route in its external communications about the launch, never once using the term NFT'.  This commitment to a seamless user experience has also proven successful in the technical side of the industry. A brainchild of NFT thought leader Richerd, <a href=""https://manifold.xyz/"" >Manifold</a> empowers developers with APIs and code frameworks to integrate NFTs into their products without requiring knowledge of how to write a smart contract. With the power of the Manifold studio, creators can use smart contract templates to mint NFTs with zero code whilst still maintaining the highest level of onchain provenance and ownership.  Meanwhile, <a href=""https://www.immutable.com/"" >ImmutableX</a>, the web3 scaling solution, recently raised $200m in a Series C fundraise round, provides web3 games with gas-free, lightning-fast transactions via just a few lines of code. The trend has always been clear, but is now obvious: eliminating the complexity of web3 is much needed for broader adoption.  Now, Op3n is looking to bring this all under one roof. Founded by Jaeson Ma, who previously co-founded the music collective 88rising, and his long-time partner Eric Tu, a branding and media executive at VICE, Op3n is an 'NFT super-app', designed to integrate all aspects of NFTs, from creation to minting, to community building. Built as a launchpad for community-owned intellectual property, Op3n comprises a TikTok-style user interface with an interoperable ecosystem of features including token-gated events and merch, community chat and live streaming, and a social marketplace.  Op3n is designed to integrate all aspects of NFTs.'  The goal? To help creators leverage web3 technology to engage fans and provide users with a convenient way of purchasing NFTs from their favorite creators.  As Op3n continues to evolve, it plans to become a comprehensive suite for NFT solutions, from the creator to the community. This entails integrating with communication apps like Discord, marketplaces like OpenSea, and metaverses like Decentraland in order to position Op3n as a vertical integrator, helping creators fundraise, coordinate, and manage their communities.  A tall task indeed, but investors are bought in on the vision and comprise some major brands in the creative industries, in web3 and beyond. After raising an initial $10 million seed round from a slew of investors including Warner Music Group, Op3n raised a $35m Series A led by video game studio Animoca Brands, who have invested broadly across the <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/a-peek-into-web3-power-player-animoca-brands/"">web3 creative economy</a>. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1690px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1690px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/637e80e8f9c7bf9ae5e2d849_1-ymJjisZQl-transformed.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Op3n plans to offer every service required for web3 creators to build their community, from the technology underlying the supply chain to the community and NFT ecosystem.

With a deliberately broad thesis, the fund is making grants to influential projects across all content mediums within music, film, entertainment, gaming, and digital art that can benefit from an NFT-augmented community strategy.  The fund's first grant was awarded to early NFT adopter and Elon Musk's one-time romantic partner Grimes, who plans to launch an intergalactic children's metaverse book' on the Avalanche blockchain, inspired by Studio Ghibli's acclaimed 1988 film  My Neighbor Totoro .

For co-founder Jaeson Ma, the ultimate goal for Op3n is to make it easier for creators to finance their projects, build a community native to the ownership economy, and one that is as simple as using Instagram or TikTok.

Documenting the history of crypto art  Panter Xhita shares her web3 journey,panter xhita,Fri Sep 23 2022 09:44:38,Panter Xhita has made waves in the crypto art space and has collaborated with CoinGecko and CoinDesk to bring her unique style to a broader audience. She speaks to Nina Knaack Knaack about equalising opportunity for artists across the world and documenting the history of cryptoart.,Fri Sep 23 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Digital-Art; Portraits; Nft; Argentina; Latin-America,Nina Knaack," Panter Xhita studied visual arts in northern Argentina, but her interest in art goes back much earlier in her life.""My mother is a sculptor, so I grew up surrounded by sculptures and also paintings by her artist friends. During my childhood I spent many of my hours playing with paint and other materials in her studio. So what started as something to entertain myself became my career over the years. And luckily, it's still just as fun.""  Having the liberty to do what you love has been amazing for Panter, although the transition from her physical work to the digital space was hard at first.""My degree is in sculpting and painting, so the shift was very big for me. I suddenly had to transfer my concepts and ideas to digital painting. It was a difficult but exciting process, especially since I had to learn to use some digital tools from scratch. In fact, if you study my work on the blockchain, you can not only see the development of my concepts, but also my skills.""  But why would a visual artist familiar with physical pieces jump into the digital rabbit hole of Web3? It's because Panter saw great possibilities within crypto art.""I actually saw the potential immediately. I understood that there was a new market developing for artists from around the world and, most importantly, that we all had equal opportunities to start with. So I didn't hesitate for a second and in a week's time left my waitress and a kid's art teacher jobs to dedicate myself to this space full time. It was crazy but so far it was the best decision I've ever made.""  Panter soon made her mark in the space. After a short period she was already making NFTs in collaboration with <a href=""https://www.coingecko.com/account/rewards/panter-xhita-x-coingecko-illusions-nft"">CoinGecko</a> and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CYb-NEcpVnO/"">CoinDesk</a>, and her work now has hundreds of collectors around the globe, with drops on the highly-curated SuperRare and Nifty Gateway. But her biggest contribution is no doubt her most recent.  A History of Crypto Art  is the product of extensive research on 90 OGs in the crypto art scene, tracing back to the beginning to record the early years of the space on-chain.  A multi-edition triptych,  A History of Crypto Art  was minted as its three separate parts on Nifty Gateway, but those who successfully collected all three components were able to burn the trio and receive the <a href=""https://www.niftygateway.com/marketplace/collection/0x62753d079a1d84994a8316b7213460b044905944/1?filters[onSale]=true&sortBy=lowest"">triptych as a whole</a>  if they did so within 48 hours of the piece launching on September 8th. Since there's so much history in the project, it received a lot of attention in the community. ""From the beginning I've been studying the history of this space, since I was interested in what had happened before I came in. I liked studying their bodies of work and of course also used these studies to understand their path and to help me forge mine.""  The actual idea to make one big digital painting with the major early figures of cryptoart came to Panter earlier this year when she was living in Mexico. She saw the works of great Mexican muralists there, like Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros.""I knew immediately. It was a very ambitious idea but luckily I was able to give myself five months to make the piece. I knew it was going to take a lot of time and for the last three months I worked on it non-stop to finish it, without any weekends or days off. It was crazy, it was very challenging and exhausting, but now that I finished I am very happy that I did it.""   ""This has definitely been a leap in my career. Sometimes you have these big moments that bring you further. This is one of them.""    Panter Xhita   The concept of  A History of Crypto Art  is a bit different from Panter's previous work.""My work is usually about the relationship between technology and nature that coexists within us. In  Insufficient  I portray a trampoline that cannot fully become a bridge to the landscape, and the object on the gray surface represents our only possible response to the immense silence of the world: culture and technology. ""It represents what we are, versus what we cannot access. Every NFT has a different object on it, but all are useless and overestimated creations. Insufficient to counteract the unfathomable and untimely mysteries of nature."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/632d85d01f9d7484e69f29b6_shadows-of-a-clich_-astronaut.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/shadows-of-a-clich%C3%A9:-astronaut-28913""> Astronaut </a> , part of Panter's  <a href=""https://panterxhita.com/shadows""> Shadows of a Clichi© </a>  collection.""How far is the sky if you are attached to the ground? Is a dream a dream if it can't fly? If it's held by bricks and stones?"" </figcaption></figure>""In my work I also often compare the crypto art scene with the reality that surrounds me.  Shadows of a Clichi©  was really about that: the stereotypes of crypto art and in what way people from third world countries are actually able to make it for themselves in the metaverse. Initially you could say that artists from the third world have a good opportunity to sustain themselves with their work through the technology of the blockchain. On the other hand, the big successes within crypto art can feel very hard to reach and it's easy to lose yourself in the space. This series is both about acknowledging the possibilities and at the same time showing the distance crypto art has to reality.""  By contrast,  A History of Crypto Art  began as a homage to the courageous and creative talents in the space; the likes of <a href=""https://twitter.com/xcopyart"">XCOPY</a>, the <a href=""https://twitter.com/MuseumofCrypto"">Museum of Crypto Art</a>, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/hellowoca"">Women of Crypto Art</a>.""This time it was really about the OGs themselves, but it still relates to my other work because it touches upon the relation between digital personas' and the real world'."" Nonetheless, you see Panter's style across the piece in how she portrays her figures.""I really like to do portraits, to attentively paint the person. In almost all my projects I have portraits and here I really focused on that part. I loved working on it.""  Panter views her projects as traces of her creative process.""Each one is special in its own way,"" she explains. However,  A History of Crypto Art  has a lot of room to grow.

" ""No artist needs to be a starving artist""  how Patrick Amadon combines aesthetics and politics to push web3 forward",patrick amadon,Mon Sep 05 2022 14:11:37,"Patrick Amadon began making glitch art over ten years ago, creating glitched versions of his own paintings and sharing them on Tumblr. In 2020, he saw that everything had changed in the digital art space, and jumped in. He speaks with Misan Harriman about the early days of glitch art, combing his political and aesthetic interests, and contributing to the dialogue. Li©a Rose Emery tells the story.",Thu Sep 01 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Glitch-Art; Digital-Art; Usa; North-America,Lea Rose Emery," ""The first thing I did was on Tez, and when I first received something for it, I realised, Wow, brave new world; we're not in Kansas anymore.'"" But NFTs are more than that, it's also a brave new world that Patrick Amadon is helping to shape. The glitch artist has built a huge following, first in the early days of digital art and now in the NFT space.  Growing up in Los Angeles,""art was never really on the radar"", besides doodling and comic book sketches. But that changed in high school, in a dark room with a giant screen, through an inspirational art history teacher who Patrick only remembers as Mr. Silva.  ""It was the way he told stories, he was engaging  it was my first real experience diving into art, and I loved it.""  Although he felt drawn towards the study of art history, it wasn't until after college with some paints and""one of those shared courtyards that every single Hollywood apartment has"", that he delved into making art with friends. Suddenly, the pieces fell into place.""Something just clicked in, this totally spontaneous event and it felt right. I went the next day, bought more paint and spiritually something just connected."" This was 2008, and soon he was studying YouTube tutorials, practising, and honing his skills. His early inspiration came from abstract artists like <a href=""https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/gerhard-richter-1841"" >Gerhard Richter</a>, before more political and social commentary began to inform his work. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63160095e5a496fcf0c5dc39_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(3).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/wagmi-35773""> Transient </a> , by Patrick Amadon. </figcaption></figure>""I really love <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/banksy-box-set"" >Banksy</a>. I know it's a popular one, but I really appreciated how most of his work is a commentary on something. I appreciate how he's always needling and commenting on something out there. I think that element is something that I like to bring into art. It's not purely aesthetic. It has to have a story. It has to have a purpose, it has to be contributing to the discussion, contributing to the dialogue.""  An early adopter of digital art, Patrick grasped the accessibility and dexterity of the sphere. He describes the arduous process of making oil paintings with layer upon layer, each taking a week or more to dry, and the limiting factor of time.""So I like digital art,"" he laughs. And through digital art, he discovered the glitch aesthetic, which spoke to him both in theory and as a medium. Photoshop doesn't need time to dry.   ""It has to be contributing to the discussion, contributing to the dialogue.""    Patrick Amadon  ""I really liked it conceptually, from the idea that it's corrupted,"" he says.""And the older glitches too, you would go in and actually corrupt the image file itself. So opening up in a word pad and seeing a huge block of code, deleting a few lines until you get a really nice aberration in the actual image. So thematically, I liked it. Conceptually, I liked it, and I just started making glitched versions of my paintings.""  From 2012 to 2016, he was very active in the digital art community, finding his way to Tumblr, as many artists now active in the NFT space once did, including <a href=""https://twitter.com/XCOPYART"" >XCOPY</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/maxcapacity"">Max Capacity</a>. But at that time, it was solely an exercise in creation, in curiosity, and in exploration. ""I mean, there was no path to money in digital art,"" he explains.""It was purely just that I felt these were interesting. I liked making them and people seemed to respond well to them."" Despite his success and growing following, personal issues led to Patrick taking a step back from the art world in 2016. When he returned in December 2020, he found that the entire landscape had changed. ""I thought to myself, Wait, this thing that we've all just been doing for fun all this time: people actually figured out technology that allows you to make this into art that people can buy.' I immediately just went fully down the rabbit hole of what an NFT is, smart contracts, all of it.""  Patrick is humble about the fans and following he developed before his break, acknowledging that he had""a bit of momentum"" from his previous digital art life that helped propel him into web3. But that same humility meant that he spent time listening and learning before delving in  and, perhaps most importantly, building a community.""I was reasonably early to the space and I just spent 12 to 14 hours a day getting to know everybody. I wasn't minting anything at the time, other than a few things on Tezos, though that was more for fun.""  For Patrick, the difference between web2 and web3 was immediately apparent. The SuperRare artist describes web2 as a""show me economy"", explaining,""you're not engaging. You're not having dialogue with people. What you're doing is just showing them things that are interesting, and if they like it, they like it and they share it. Web3 is not the same: people are interested in connecting with you and building out a network, a web, and a community of people.""  Those early days""felt very pure and good"", and he describes an""idyllic version of art in a decentralised community"". But he also witnessed how the monetisation and decentralisation allows artists to move away from traditional gatekeeping structures. How it allows both those who haven't had an exposure to the traditional art world to dive in and develop a passion, while at the same time creating a space for artists to reap the benefits of the value of their work. ""I think one of the most beautiful things about the space is that for creatives in general  art, music, photography  there's been such strong structures built, to extract value from the creatives, that people have to just be a part of because they're so established,"" he says.""There's no reason for an artist to be a starving artist. And there's so many myths around that whole thing that just make life miserable for being an artist.""  But while he's""bullish about the direction we're headed"" in web3, he's also acutely aware of the direction we need to travel in  and what we can learn from recent booms and busts.""I felt like there was a good case study and a good demonstration of the value of NFTs. The fact that people could create collectibles that people would then see value in, I think was interesting,"" he says.""The downside? Call it monkey JPEG casino culture, right; people just purely gambling. I think that's obviously unhealthy and so much of it was an unsustainable bubble, but it did introduce a lot of people to NFTs.""  In a growing space teeming with excitement and expansion, he's aware that it's easy to""lose focus or just focus on yourself entirely""  an instinct it's clear he has no interest in. Instead, he's focused on expanding in the right ways, for everyone.  In part, that means being an active liaison for newcomers to web3. He spends his Thursdays hosting web3 onboardings, meetups, and panels, though he admits he's a""bit of a masochist"" and happy to tackle questions and naysaying first-hand in pursuit of a wider goal.""The whole premise of everything we're doing is community. So how you build that online and in real life.""   ""There's no reason for an artist to be a starving artist.""    Patrick Amadon   While his role is partially spreading awareness, he's also an active voice shaping the space. In the next five years he sees a shifting focus on AR (rather than VR),""seamlessly making that transition back and forth"" between physician and digital art, but most importantly he sees that it's crucial to remember the purpose and potential arena. ""I feel like it's incumbent on the people that have a voice to help make this better. We're helping people reclaim sovereignty in so many different ways with web3. Whether that's just freedom from regulations, financial empowerment, responsibility with your wallet  I mean, all of these things are about giving people back power."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:933px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""933px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/631601b86a2fa104157853db_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(4).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/1st-st-bridge-32011"" target=""_blank""><em>1st St Bridge </a><em>, by Patrick Amadon. </figcaption></figure> His own work is a reflection of that. After a bit of constructive criticism from Jerry Saltz, the American art critic, Patrick made the journey from abstracts to socially and politically motivated work. ""Jerry said, You know, this is pure zombie formalism. You need to, uh, you need to start over,'"" Patrick recalls.""I just really appreciated the viewpoint; I thought about it and I knew that he was right. There were things about my art that I feel like I just hadn't accepted yet. I always knew it could go in a different direction. I just didn't know which direction that was, but I knew it was missing something.""  Soon, he expanded to pieces on the early days of the Syrian conflict, on the attack on Boris Nemstov, on Ferguson, Missouri. No longer was his interest in political and social justice separate from his art  he combined them, making his art a vehicle for awareness and change. And in this way, he sees the space   as   not only helping artists gain exposure and feel valued, but also as a place that can elevate voices and causes from around the globe. He's working on a project with <a href=""https://outrightinternational.org/"">OutRight International</a> to help raise awareness for LGBT issues, and sees these larger social causes as the true potential of web3. And these wider goals are clearly never far from his mind, as he's ready to push the space in that direction. ""A lot of people around the world come up with a way to sustainably support their families via art,"" he says.""But obviously there's so much more work to do. So we can't lose focus on that.""

Personal Tokens: what they are and how they work,personal tokens,Thu Aug 04 2022 13:07:51,Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg explains how Vitalik Buterin's newest vision could change your life and become a foundation of a decentralised society.,Thu Aug 04 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Personal-Tokens; Vitalik-Buterin; Infrastructure,Randy Ginsburg," Eight years ago, Vitalik Buterin changed the world with the publishing of the <a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/"" > Ethereum Whitepaper </a>. Since then, he's published a handful of other written works outlining updates to the Ethereum ecosystem and visions of a new future, but perhaps none grander than his most recent.  In the 37-page whitepaper titled<a href=""https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763"" >  Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul </a>, Buterin and fellow authors E. Glen Weyl and Puja Ohlhaver outline a vision for a fully decentralised society,""where Souls and communities come together bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to create plural network goods and intelligence, at a range of scales.""   In layman's terms, Buterin et al. are aiming to create a decentralised society built upon non-transferable relationships and facts. And Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) are the key to it all.  What is a Soulbound Token?   Soulbound Tokens are permanent, non-transferable NFTs that are, more or less, attached to your private blockchain wallet for life. The name Soulbound is inspired by the name given to a subset of items in World of Warcraft which, once picked up, cannot be transferred to another player. The name hasn't been universally popular, and like everything else in web3, it's a work in progress. At Culture3 we're calling them Personal Tokens' for now.  In Buterin's decentralised society, these personal tokens will serve as an extension of one's personal identity, representing your commitments and affiliations across various relationships, like with employers, educational institutions, and government bodies. Each publicly visible, non-transferable (but possibly-revocable-by-the-issuer) token can be issued and stored in private wallets labeled by Buterin as""Souls.""  For example, a university could issue a personal token to its graduates. A startup could issue a personal token to its first 100 employees. Freelancers or independent contractors can receive personal tokens to verify the quality of their work and relationships with clients. Governments can administer official documents like IDs and passports to make them impossible to forge. Similar to a self-certified 'badge' of affiliation, like listing your alma mater or previous employer in your Twitter bio, each personal token represents a verifiable relationship between an individual and an institution, signaling your reputation in a credible way. ""The idea is to bolster people's social identities by customizing them with unique, non-exchangeable badges. In theory, the tokens could help solve some of the problems ravaging decentralised finance, like scams and theft,"" Buterin writes.  The most comparable example of Personal Tokens today, as outlined in Buterik's blog post <a href=""https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html"" > Soulbound </a> ,  are   <a href=""https://poap.xyz/#:~:text=POAPs%20are%20digital%20mementos%2C%20minted,unlock%20a%20world%20of%20possibilities."" >Proof-of-Attendance-Protocol badges</a>, also known as POAPs .  Initially created for ETHDenver 2019 to reward fellow hackers for their attendance, POAPs serve as commemorative proof that an individual attended a certain event. But unlike Personal Token, POAPs are still transferable. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1185px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1185px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ebc3c73f94689a876c1d1f_7ltpFBFVpd7DzUXRhFkXEuuUBxputQAltkWe-5QO3KTfa-LHXjlxkDU-DELvDEP6wXfZ2HR1jWfNRvRZb-hZggyqQrb7ZqTOuRFlrkUpzF85zpBWLTcFtg3YdgDwTm4o0uEAsmiM5fua-oSm_gz_pHM.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > POAPs are usually used to certify attendance at events or early membership. </figcaption></figure> In theory, I could bribe a friend to sell me a POAP that signaled his attendance at the Harvard graduation ceremony. Now, although I never attended a single class at Harvard, I own the badge that signals I spent four years there. Clearly, you can see the issue here; that signal becomes far weaker when it can be sold to the highest bidder.  Buterin argues that Personal Tokens aim to address a key issue that the web3 ecosystem has yet to solve: its reliance on centralised authorities to verify social identity.  Most artists rely on platforms like OpenSea and Twitter to commit to scarcity, whilst DAOs fall back on web2 social media to strengthen governance; the large majority of cryptocurrency holders store their tokens in custodial exchanges. As much as we  want  to be decentralised, the existing web3 ecosystem is far from it, partly because using those decentralised alternatives is, right now, far from easy. As well as offering genuine advantages to how existing societal structures verify personal information, Personal Tokens fill a gap by creating truly web3-native social identities and are fundamental to how a truly decentralised society functions.  How would Personal Tokens work?   To administer a Personal Token from one wallet (Soul) to another, the creator of the token must grant the transfer to the recipient's private wallet, thus attesting to these social relations. This power ensures that only the proper recipients and affiliates receive the Soul, thereby eliminating any possibility of false credentialing. It's important to note that given its function as a form of web3-native identity, there is no requirement for a Personal Token to be linked to a legal name.  Yet, the ability to allow any individual or institution to send Personal Tokens creates instances where they aren't desired by the recipient.  This issue is already rampant in the existing web3 ecosystem, where unwanted or fraudulent tokens are sent to user wallets unannounced, sometimes associated with scams. For individuals with high degrees of influence, this causes an additional problem as it can signal an endorsement of, a specific collection, further influencing others to buy. In May last year, Vitalik Buterin was sent trillions of Shiba Inu tokens in an attempt to increase the price. The Ethereum co-founder burnt most of the coins and donated the remainder to create a scholarship <a href=""https://cryptopotato.com/vitalik-buterin-funded-ai-research-grant-with-last-years-shiba-inu-donation/"" >programme</a> for tackling existential risks associated with artificial intelligence.  To combat this, NFT marketplaces like OpenSea have provided users with the ability to hide certain NFTs within their wallets. And of course, you can always burn tokens as well. The authors write that Personal Tokens will incorporate similar features, letting individuals hide select tokens from public view, and perhaps even destroy them. This kind of feature should be executed with nuance, such as to prevent bad borrowers hiding their credit history, or prevent freelancers hiding client engagements that went badly, but it is key to making Personal Tokens and Soul wallets common and useful. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2400px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2400px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ec4059873931e2a478fc1d_emily-karakis-T-tVt4xsCdE-unsplash.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Universities like Harvard could use Personal Tokens to confirm your graduation. Far better than a physical certificate that you've probably lost. </figcaption></figure> Personal Token use cases   While the general use case for Personal Tokens as a provenance mechanism that verifies your past work and relationships is rather straightforward, it's what individuals and institutions can do with a web3-native social identity that is truly remarkable.  Within Buterin's envisioned decentralised society, social identities can serve as immutable and transparent records of credit-relevant history, replacing traditional credit history requirements that too-frequently are shown to be biased with methods that aren't hidden inside corporate HQs. Moreover, this new system can be designed to refute the bias toward underserved communities that have not accumulated sufficient credit data. Users would be able to""stake"" funds or their reputation to avoid collateral requirements, in a similar way to which <a href=""https://www.generationhome.com/"" >Generation Home</a> lets parents contribute to their children's mortgages when they buy their first house  but on a much broader scale.  Loans and credit lines could be represented as revocable, non-transferable Personal Tokens, which can be burned or replaced with a new Personal Token to mark the repayment of the loan. Inversely, a default on a loan would be negatively marked with an additional Personal Token, and serve as a warning sign for future banks and institutions. Buterin takes this idea to its natural long-term evolution, highlighting the potential for open-source lending markets within social communities.  Next comes community governance. For governance to be widely distributed among competent individuals, it must be non-transferable. Otherwise, transferability allows those with money and conflicted interests to intervene. In the case of CityDAO, who are working to build an on-chain, community-governed, crypto city, the ability of government officials to award citizens with  non-transferable  proof of citizenship, and thereby voting power on key decisions, is crucial to creating a stable and sustainable democracy.  Of course, none of these examples come without flaws or controversy, but the potential of their impact to create a more decentralised and equitable future is undeniable.  But, what happens if you lose your 'Soul'?  With hacks, scams, and general malpractice rampant throughout the Web3 ecosystem, it's an obvious fear:  what happens if you lose access to your Soul wallet via a hack or loss of a private key?   To answer this, Buterin has proposed a contingency plan labeled the""community recovery model."" Based on the idea of a social recovery model where users can appoint a set of individuals or institutions as""guardians"" of their Soul, community recovery relies on the intersectional vote of users' social networks. In the event of a hack, or if a private key is compromised, recovering access to a Soul would require the consent of a qualified majority of a random subset of Souls communities.  For example, let's say a Soul held Personal Tokens from Harvard, CityDAO, my local synagogue, and my previous employer. I, or my appointed guardians, would need the consent of a member of each community in order to regain access. Granting the broader community the ability to assist in the recovery process minimises the flaws inherent in the general social recovery process like death, relationships souring, or people simply falling out of touch.  Risks of SBTs   Despite the obvious upsides, Personal Tokens and the societal emphasis on social-reputation-backed credit still comes with sizeable risk around privacy, discrimination, and bias, much of which is acknowledged by the paper's co-authors.  Black Mirror's episode Nosedive ‚Äì or even <a href=""https://www.wired.co.uk/article/china-social-credit-system-explained"" >China's social credit system</a> in real life ‚Äì illustrates how these initiatives can backfire, reinforce biases and discrimination, or be tools for oppression. Bad actors might target them for harassment, whilst governing bodies can deny opportunities and resources, such as medical care, travel, and voting rights, to certain segments of society. It's important to remember that whilst many people have many reasons to share their identity, there are others who would prefer aspects of their identity to remain private to them. ""Just as the downside of having a heart is that a heart can be broken, the downside of having a Soul is it can go to hell and the downside of having a society is that societies are often animated by hatred, prejudice, violence, and fear. Humanity is a great and often tragic experiment,"" writes Buterin.  And an experiment it is. Co-author E. Glen Weyl has hinted that early use cases of Personal Tokens <a href=""https://twitter.com/iamjasonlevin/status/1527316024659353601"" >could become available by the end of 2022,</a> and the potential of Personal Tokens as both a pillar of decentralised societies and as having genuine use cases for existing institutions certainly deserves respect. However, we expect that Personal Tokens will have to be the subject of significant discussion by the community to navigate these thorny issues before their applications and use cases are rolled out at scale.

Piter suddenly found himself coding more complex variations because he knew that they would actually be seen now.""Before, I did not even bother because nobody would delve that deep into the outputs. And now, people are taking the time to look at a single outcome for longer, because they can collect them separately,"" he says.   NFTs and generative art are a perfect match, Piter argues.""It finally provides a platform for all the generated images from one code to be displayed and appreciated together as individual artworks. As a coder, this is an incredibly special experience for me."" ",2178
Plus NFTs: how corporates are adopting NFTs to drive employee-led innovation,plus company nft collection,Tue Sep 20 2022 11:02:09,"Could NFTs and DAOs be the future of employee-led innovation? Plus Company thinks so. A global network of 25 creative agencies, the organisation is turning to NFTs to encourage cross-company collaboration and build the foundations for an innovation DAO, led by the network's most engaged employees.",Tue Sep 20 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Communities-augmented,Internal-Nft-Collections; Polygon,Ola Kalejaye," It makes sense that Plus Company is an enthusiastic adopter of web3. After all, the creative agency network was born in <a href=""https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/woty"" >the year of NFTs</a>. But it's the way in which Plus Company is approaching web3 that is most intriguing.  An unmistakable calling card of 2021's NFT euphoria was the sheer number of global brands rushing into the space, looking for ways to capitalise. In fact, to hear an NFT purist tell it, the current bear market could be perceived as a just reward for those who entered the space in the last year with the intention of profiting from the space and little else.  Fortunately, with global markets in dire straits and the NFT space not excluded from that, there is more space for the builders to shine, freed, somewhat, from the distractions of price speculation. Included in this are companies entering the web3 not in an attempt to make a quick profit, but to leverage it to bring genuine improvements to how their business works. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" style=""max-width:50%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright"" data-rt-max-width=""50%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/632998cb1ff03486afdd0be3_Plus%20Company%20Wrapped%20NFT.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > The PlusConnect NFTs come wrapped, and employees can unwrap them by burning it in exchange for the real thing: a dynamic NFT that evolves as it interacts with other tokens. </figcaption></figure> Plus Company appears to be one such outfit, and it hopes that its recently launched NFT staff collection, PlusConnect, will unlock a new age of employee empowerment and creativity for its network of agencies. A network of 25 creative agencies, Plus Company is labelling its Connect collection a""gamified experience"" for its over 3,000 employees.  That comes through via the dynamic, generative artwork at the heart of the NFTs. With 25 base designs, each one reflecting the brand DNA of one of the agencies that make up the Plus Company network, these NFTs start off as simple 3D shapes, but how they change is where things get interesting.  Every time two employees interact with one another, their NFTs will evolve, turning their basic 3D shapes into entirely unique generative artworks. The more connections employees make, the more intricate these complex and colorful structures become.  This clever way of evolving NFT artwork reflects some of PlusCompany's goals in launching the collection. Of course, it introduces its employees to NFTs and the blockchain who might not otherwise be familiar, but it goes much deeper than that. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63299aa2ac0c4482e034b15d_Screenshot_1.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > PlusConnect holders use their NFT as a digital scorecard, ticking off each agency as they collaborate across the Plus Company network. As they do, the artwork evolves and their score rise. </figcaption></figure> With thousands of creatives split across five continents, Plus Company is a network built upon collaboration between its member agencies. These NFTs become a tangible representation of that inter-agency collaboration in real-time and are an early example of how companies might use <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/personal-tokens"" >Personal (or Soulbound) Tokens</a> to bring accreditations on-chain.  At the time of writing, <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/plusconnect"" >736</a> Plus Company employees have minted NFTs, which will can be evolved over a period of three months, at which point the collection will be locked and preserved on the Polygon network.  There's one last element to the PlusConnect NFTs and it might just be the most intriguing innovation on Plus Company's part, and that's their Innovation DAO.  We've seen a range of different communities experiment with DAOs as a fresh, blockchain-enabled <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/welcome-to-the-commune"">way of organising</a>. Plus Company, for whom success as a network is heavily dependent on both the strength of its inter-agency collaboration, is pursuing similar ideas as one of the first corporate organisations to experiment with the non-hierarchal structure.   Much like in other web3 communities, Plus Company emphasises that the first members of the DAO  "" which will manage the company's first employee-directed innovation fund  "" will comprise employees from each agency, selected based not on seniority but on engagement with the PlusConnect collection. ""Traditional agency networks tend to be top-down, heavy-handed, and bureaucratic. Fresh, original thinking doesn't easily flourish under those conditions, so we're taking a contrarian approach,"" says Brett Marchand, Plus Company's CEO.  By doubling as the launch of the Innovation DAO, the PlusConnect NFTs are the beginning of a radical new experiment for Plus Company. One that could become a model for future creative agencies to follow.""We're handing this project over to our most engaged employees  "" no matter the level  "" to lead the way for what is next for Plus Company and our clients in the web3 space.""  PlusConnect bodes well as a promising, pioneering use case for NFTs to foster inter-company collaboration that lives beyond market speculation. Expect to see many more companies forming their own DAOs and experimenting with internal collections in the future. ",1608
Protect Protocol: the fight against art theft in web3,protect protocol,Wed Sep 07 2022 11:27:13,"Billions are lost to scams in web3. One of the most underappreciated is the simple theft of digital art and selling it as your own. Everyone else suffers: artists, who are not compensated for their work, and collectors, who thought they were joining an artist's community. Ekin Geniß explores DeviantArt's Protect Protocol, which has alerted artists to over half a billion potential thefts.",Wed Sep 07 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Nft; Deviantart; Art-Tools; Polygon; Ethereum; Klaytn; Tezos; Arbitrum; Flow; SOla Kalejayena; Optimism; Palm; Applications,Ekin Genc," For two decades, digital artists and art have found a welcoming community at DeviantArt, the social network with an emphasis on art display. The platform <a href=""https://www.deviantartsell.com/?utm_source=DA&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=DA_top_nav&utm_id=DA_top_nav"" >boasts</a> more than 70 million registered users and exceeds 100 million visits every month. Millions of original images are uploaded to the platform every day, making it the go-to hub for digital creators. But that comes with a problem: it's also the go-to target for digital art thieves.  The playbook for NFT art theft is simple and easy: go to DeviantArt, download an original artwork, then mint it as an NFT, hoping for an unwitting NFT collector to pay you for it. No skin off your nose after it sells, if ever. ""I'm in tears,"" <a href=""https://twitter.com/sodasprouts/status/1467882040892833801"" >tweeted</a> 19-year-old artist sodasprouts.""Daft Punk art I made to promote  One More Time Zine  (a charity project) was stolen and sold for $12,000+ worth of cryptocurrency.""  It's not good for collectors who unwittingly buy an NFT based on stolen artwork either. Finding out that an artwork is the product of someone else immediately undermines the value of the digital asset, for the same reason that enormous resources are invested to ensure the legitimacy of physical art. Yet although authenticity does matter, it would be a mistake to treat this as a mere authenticity problem for digital art.  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:56.199999999999996%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""56.199999999999996%"" data-rt-dimensions=""500:281"" data-page-url=""https://twitter.com/sodasprouts/status/1467882040892833801""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=96f1f04c5f4143bcb0f2e68c87d65feb&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/sodasprouts/status/1467882040892833801&image=https%3A//abs.twimg.com/errors/logo46x38.png"" title=""ü™¥ artie ü™¥ @ DragonCon! on Twitter: &quot;I'm in tears.

JPEGs may look pretty on the surface, but the authentic, non-fungible token under the surface is what provides membership of an artist's community. In faking art that provides no access to the artist, art theft is problematic for everyone in the ecosystem.  To tackle the ever-growing problem of art theft in web3, DeviantArt launched in August last year an AI-powered tool called <a href=""https://www.deviantartprotect.com/"" >Protect Protocol</a>, which scans blockchains and alerts artists to any of their artwork that may be minted as NFTs. So far it has worked wonders.  RJ Palmer, a concept artist known for his <a href=""https://www.rj-palmer.com/realistic-pokemon"" >realistic Pokemon</a> illustrations, is one of the many artists who <a href=""https://twitter.com/arvalis/status/1440449173724151820"" >used the tool</a> to detect and report his artwork minted by others as NFTs.""Thanks to DeviantArt's NFT reporting feature I have been alerted to some jackass who stole a ton of Pokemon art and listed them as NFTs ... there's a ton of other artists [sic] work taken."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:4096px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""4096px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/631885fd2910568f42f08144_E_2DgznVUAolhj5.jpeg"" alt=""Image""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption >  ""Here is my original art that was stolen, ya know, if you wanted to see Venusaur for some reason,""  <a href=""https://www.rj-palmer.com/realistic-pokemon""> RJ Palmer </a> . </figcaption></figure> Scanning nine public blockchains  "" Ethereum, Klaytn, Polygon, Solana, Arbitrum, Optimism, Palm, Tezos, and Flow  "" Protect identifies NFTs that have an identical match or, as in RJ Palmer's case, a near-identical match. There is no escape for art thieves via minimal effort to slightly alter the work.  Rather than taking action on its own, the tool alerts the artist and gives them the option to send a pre-filled Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) request, which would compel NFT marketplaces to take down the offending NFT.  <a href=""https://www.protectprotocol.io"" >Protect's statistics</a> show the scale of the problem. Since launching last August, the Protocol has indexed over 500 million NFTs and alerted creators to over 400,000 potential infringements. Although Ethereum is the most popular blockchain for NFTs, Polygon ranks number one for stolen NFT art, with an infringement rate of around 5,750 infringements per million NFTs  "" nearly twice as many cases as on Ethereum. The other seven blockchains all have considerably fewer offending NFTs, with Optimism and Palm the most authentic chains for NFTs. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1104px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1104px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6318880c3e883478d7224abc_pp.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> </figure> In May, DeviantArt extended the tool beyond its community of artists.""High praise from the on-site creator community inspired DeviantArt to extend Protect and its safeguarding powers to a standalone service, allowing any creator  "" not just DeviantArt members  "" to leverage this technology,"" Moti Levy, CEO of DeviantArt, told Culture3.  The free version of the tool lets you upload up to 10 images totaling 2gb. But more prolific artists may want to sign up to the Core Pro service for $9.95 per month, allowing them to upload up to 1,000 images totaling 50gb.  Sometimes the art theft in web3 is as simple as reminting already-minted artwork. In May, OpenSea <a href=""https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/improving-authenticity-on-opensea-updates-to-verification-and-copymint-prevention/"" >launched</a> internal tools to fight what it calls 'copymints'  "" exact replicas of already-minted NFTs. The platform also made moves to limit 'lazy minting', its on-site feature to mint an NFT, to 50 NFTs at a time, since <a href=""https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1493787767029088262"" >over 80 percent</a> of copyright violations were created with that tool. That attempt received a backlash from creators asking OpenSea not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. The feature is widely used by original artists as well; the platform had to backtrack.  Sometimes copymints appear across chains, throwing off marketplaces that don't run cross-chain checks. In July, NFT artist <a href=""https://twitter.com/landlinesart1"" >landlinesart</a>'s collection on Tezos was copied by a scammer who managed to <a href=""https://twitter.com/RallyRolly/status/1551633124403974144"" >get it verified</a> on LooksRare, which runs on Ethereum. NFT art theft can even be a problem for invitation-only platforms like <a href=""https://twitter.com/rinrinarts/status/1504561804868927520"" >Foundation</a>, which pride themselves on exclusivity and high-quality art, though highly-curated platforms like SuperRare appear to have enough barriers to entry to mitigate the problem.  Despite all the efforts to tackle copyminting, there is only so much an NFT marketplace can do. They do not have the power to remove NFTs from the blockchain; after all, blockchain records are immutable and permissionless; they exist without anyone's consent. The tokens will continue to have their metadata pointing to stolen images wherever those images may be hosted, most likely on censorship-resistant decentralised file storage networks like IPFS.  But the incentives to mint stolen artwork exist because there are potential collectors. Without collectors falling for such scams, those incentives may diminish and the problem may eventually disappear. Until then, it is just a game of whack-a-mole. ",2382

Growing up in a small town near Amsterdam in the 1990s, you had to make a call to get on the internet, and his bedroom had no phone connection.""Offline gaming was all I did, until a friend of mine showed me some work on DeviantArt. I never really had a connection with art per se; my mom and dad were both elementary school teachers and we didn't go to museums much. My grandpa was an art collector, but I never consciously thought about art. However, Deviant Art triggered me and from that moment onwards I started creating."" ""Instead of doing homework or some kind of team sport, I was making digital art and loving it. I could express myself with my Photoshop creations and would put those online. Other people responded to that and I really liked connecting with them. Sometimes it's hard to find your own crowd, especially in a small town, but the internet makes it so much easier.""   ""This all changed when Facebook, and especially Instagram, came around.""    Rik Oostenbroek   But Rik wanted to make digital art more than a hobby. He dropped out of his economics degree on the very first day: Photoshop was how he spent his time and was the only thing he wanted to do. He quickly became better and was often asked to design small pieces for local clubs and small companies. Gradual growth turned into a huge leap when he was asked to create a design for a Volkswagen campaign. He was only 17 years old at the time.""This was a bizarre moment, landing a job that big while my friends where living their student lives.""  But that was just the beginning of a period of non-stop work. Clients included Nike, Apple, Mercedes-Benz, Adidas, Adobe, Paramount, and many more.""Of course it was great that I could work for such big brands and make quite some money with it, but after a while it didn't spark me much joy anymore. I didn't feel the freedom to really create as an artist. ""For clients, advertisement was in mind; you had to do certain tricks to make something attractive. I couldn't include much of my own illustrations, whereas I really wanted to show and incorporate cool, new ideas that I had.

I just executed the ideas of others. I didn't learn much, and that felt like such a shame because there were a lot of ideas that I didn't work on creatively.""  Instead, Rik started to teach himself how to work with different programs to get the feeling of creative freedom back. He took on Illustrator, 3D, and animation, whilst also exploring the concepts behind typology.""Just for the sake of making, creating, sharing and learning. On repeat."" He shared his creations on Instagram and found increasing popularity on the platform.""That's where I could really post my own work, not the things I did on commission.""   ""With clients, everything was decided beforehand. I just had to execute the ideas of others.""    Rik Oostenbroek   Rik's style is hard to describe. He works very intuitively and is inspired by all the things he sees around him.""I soak up everything I encounter and specifically focus on colour combinations and textures. Then I try to recreate those in the digital world, altering compositions until I think it looks really nice and interesting together; the shapes, colours, surfaces, and patterns."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1920px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1920px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/633c0b2e2de2de6dcac85499_29.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://cdn.myportfolio.com/ece4082eba9c38dc0f3c50180d62b0e9/f12f29c0-77b7-45db-bc63-6f3703dfb3a8_rw_1920.jpg?h=1f2663fc291fc6e84e6285e7cf4a1652""> Arcus 29 </a> , by Rik Oostenbroek. </figcaption></figure>""Interestingly enough,"" he adds, ""I then got asked by clients to make personal things for their brands. Fully within my own style. That was a big shift because I could really create what I wanted."" But even though being able to use his own style and creativity within his commissions, it would still be the client who had the final say on the piece.""I had a lot of jobs coming at me and it sometimes felt very hard to say no: as if you can't miss the opportunities that are being given to you, because now I'm still relevant'. I decided to take a sabbatical for a year, but then the Beeple sale happened.""  Ultimately, Rik didn't take that year off and instead threw himself into web3 in February 2021.""Damn it, I thought. I've been making digital art for sixteen years now so I can't  not  do anything with NFTs. It felt like a big breakthrough that digital art was finally accepted as real art', instead of needing to work with oil on canvas to be taken seriously.""  ""The fact that there was now an interest in digital art, also from art historians and art critics, was something I felt I had to take advantage of. That attention had never been there and because of that you sometimes didn't believe in yourself as a digital artist. It was as if your work matters less and you're just a tool for brands to market a product. But now it could actually be worth something, on its own.""  This transition was a combination of strange but great sensations for Rik.""It wasn't just about likes and comments anymore. It was such a big change, for me and also for many others, to sell your digital art like that. I also felt like I found a new community again, a little bit like I had back in the day on DeviantArt, but now on a bigger scale; I love to be inspired by others online and to share and discuss with them. There's so much talent on so many levels, and web3 is the place where it can all come together.""  Eighteen months after he first started, Rik has had tremendous success in NFTs. He recalls the first time he made a sale.""For me it was a very bizarre feeling as well. I even felt a bit guilty about it, as if it wasn't justified."" His first collector found him, as is now usual, through a retweet.""He is now a very good friend and trusted advisor. He also bought the second and third work that I minted."" It felt quite absurd for Rik that he had already sold pieces for high prices. With success, in his mind, came responsibility.""This was super cool of course, but also very intimidating. I felt pressure when thinking about what I was going to mint next."" ""It almost started to feel like work' again, as if you had to put something successful out there."" Because of that, Rik waited a long time before minting new work. His next collection came four months later, with <em>Arcus , inspired by the""dense, horizontal, roll-shaped clouds sometimes occurring at the lower front portion of a cumulonimbus cloud.""   ""I even felt a bit guilty about [making a sale].""    Rik Oostenbroek   Altogether,  Arcus  took Rik five years to create, and captures his evolution throughout the different stages of his creative career; pursuing""acceptance in the way I am."" Instead of fighting his weaknesses, through Arcus, he found a way to put it into his work. More than any of his other artworks, it is  Arcus  that he feels summarises the Rik Oostenbroek style'. ""It still occurred to me though that I constantly thought about what I had to do next and I noticed I wanted to be meaningful in the space somehow."" Inspired by the success of  Arcus  and his latest work, <em>Self , Rik extended an <a href=""https://twitter.com/RikOostenbroek/status/1566762426942513152"">invitation</a> to his community: ""A creative exploration and open invitation to collaborate on my last mint; Self.

He adds, ""I think that lends to the wider sharing of ideas worldwide."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62fba2f697dcb61f2ccea2b3_pLqWcSELhy_0NhoOSLIKC08wbusoQaIFb3BA0I7p07fLG5CB6LIOEAvbCvYECv7lN8GXtN1ffv_yhAsmtTpiPnaIzXr1nW-yqM0KfOiydf6ldXFlkFgSKRXHlGcsidIh0V2ry8Ouv1K3drv6P4xSTw.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/convergence-(1-of-21)-7024"">CONVERGENCE (1 OF 21)</a>, by ROBNESS. ""Oversaturation reveals beautiful patterns on a photo if worked and tuned correctly, whilst also providing some unintended dramatic effect.""</figcaption></figure> Robness' life has always involved digital art  "" and art in general  "" but music was his preferred avenue earlier in life, from around the age of 13 through to his 20s. It was through music that he first gained an appreciation for fine art. Specifically, as the story goes, for the Andy Warhol cover of the 1967 album,  The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico.   ""I had weird entrances to art appreciation. Even when I would buy compact discs, I was always interested in the whole package deal. I liked the artists that would not just care about the music, they would actually care about the presentation of it, the aesthetic of the art cover, and what was inside it.""  Naturally, this appreciation for art and aesthetics evolved into experimentation with the tools that were popping up during Robness' youth.""My first introduction to digital art was, luckily, getting my hands on an old Microtek scanner from the 90's. Just being a young kid, trying to make counterfeit magic cards, you know? Using Photoshop 1.0 and being completely in awe of that.""  As with many of his artistic influences, much of Robness' philosophy invokes a clear anti-establishment streak. Robness notes the Occupy Wall Street Movement as a major milestone in establishing his countercultural sensibilities. The LA native had his own tent amongst the thousands that overwhelmed the Los Angeles City Hall in autumn 2011. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62fba2f6f90ef0e3b2963891_fk6lSVE4QH352CWNbQIKFesCUInnNwpUZbSuyui6zyw6bNKoMON3LfGvzrtTthqBhAlTzTs8uShgQeIhJgTnEEPnwWgy0EamZ1zAi7Oikr-C62RO3zdaN4WxMHd3Nv-HxXtbVGHkQxoE9oNkQv59Yw.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x1702bea2755d076adf737b785926b086eff36f75/211""> Mirror Data </a> , by ROBNESS. </figcaption></figure> The years after the Occupy movement faded from public consciousness left many searching for a new angle on the revolution."" Occupy Wall Street had a cultural moment and everybody took notice of it, but it fizzled out at the end. It didn't really strike the heart like everybody wanted."" Robness, like many others, saw a better answer in cryptocurrency. ""When I finally came across Bitcoin, I realised that instead of using cardboard signs and going down the street, the real tool of resistance is a financial instrument. That was my big aha moment. Crypto is the protest sign of the 21st century.""  S tumbling into NFTs, before NFTs   To tell the story of Robness' NFT journey involves calling on the humble beginnings of today's crypto art movement. Specifically, the foundational Bitcoin protocol, Counterparty. Though often overlooked, Counterparty effectively allowed users to create tokens on the blockchain, opening the door for the NFT space that we know today. The collection of Rare Pepes that emerged on Counterparty in 2016 is widely believed to be the first set of NFTs ever  "" a full year before Crypto Kitties or CryptoPunks. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" style=""max-width:45%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright"" data-rt-max-width=""45%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62fbaa1eb4d25d0938d6e2e0_ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/brute-trash-can-7122""> BRUTE TRASH CAN </a> , by ROBNESS. </figcaption></figure> Robness recalls immediately grasping the energy that would ultimately power today's early NFT space when he saw that Rare Pepe.""I was starting to use Counterparty a lot more, and then all of a sudden I see a Rare Pepe asset. And I know meme culture pretty well, so I knew the joke immediately when I saw it. It was like someone put out a beacon call or a Batman signal: someone's trying to preserve memes on the blockchain.""  For those acquainted with today's attribution-less internet, the ability to preserve and prove both ownership and creator credit of memes in this way, or any other digital asset, was inherently revolutionary. Robness saw the tangible benefits that this feature could bring even in this early experiment. ""Some people were selling their Rare Pepes to put food on the table in Venezuela. There was a lot of weird stuff happening that had us starting to realise that this can actually cause a bit of change in the world.""  Robness was deeply connected with the community of early Counterparty crypto art traders via Twitter and Telegram around that time. The practice of internet connoisseurs from around the globe creating new art markets through trading memes ended up being a prototype not just of one type of NFT market, but NFT culture as a whole.  ç The King of Trash Art   Eventually, the Rare Pepe collection closed and Robness went back to living his normal life. But only for about a year and a half. Soon enough, the NFT space would progress enough for Robness to re-enter. ""When 'the crypto thing' happened, that was a whole coalescing of different things put together, and I just found a perfect outlet to start releasing material digitally again.""  Robness began minting NFTs on SuperRare and KnownOrigin back in 2019, selling <a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/virtual-skies-x-6215"">art</a> for 0.15 eth, then worth $18. The prolific artist has experimented with a wide variety of styles since, creating captivating stills and psychedelic moving images influenced by Pop Art, collage, glitch, and more. But the art movement most associated with Robness is the one for which he might be the most infamous advocate: Trash Art. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:640px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""640px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62fcf67cd7f3f31d84b0d833_64gt%20(1).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/64-gallon-toter-7323""> 64 GALLON TOTER </a> , by ROBNESS. ""Another very relevant and truly deep conversation."" </figcaption></figure> The Trash Art movement is, in a way, a perfect example of the irreverent, innately anti-institutional humor and speech that colours a significant core of crypto culture. Much like traders joined retail investors in thumbing their noses at traditional finance, Trash Art connoisseurs laugh at traditional conceptions of what does, or does not, qualify as art.  Trash Art creators emphasised""lazy"" remixes of existing works or other images taken from brands or other elements of mainstream culture. Robness' first experience of backlash on those NFT marketplaces came out of his use of the app PhotoMosh, a popular tool amongst Trash artists. Certain sectors of the crypto art space argued that pieces created on PhotoMosh were devaluing the standards of art on those platforms.  They weren't real art .  The eventual removal of Robness'  64 GALLON TOTER,  and his entire profile, from SuperRare sparked a major backlash from the Trash Art community, who stepped up for Robness. While he eventually got back onto the platform, he says that Trash Art supporters still regularly send him remixes of the piece to this day. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:640px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""640px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62fcf870260f9587659121f9_62fcf841673aa088058348.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/banned-in-china-1.03-5566""> Banned In China 1.03 </a> , by ROBNESS. </figcaption></figure> Robness was ahead of the curve when it came to the potential of NFTs. So when a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/beeple-nft-auction-closes-at-record-setting-69-3m"" >certain historical sale</a> announced NFTs to the world in early 2021, Robness had long seen the writing on the wall. The Beeple sale triggered a flood of mainstream attention into NFTs, and given that Robness has generated the most attention for art that has gone against the grain, one might expect that he might harbour ill feelings to the space's rapid growth. This is the artist, after all, who made headlines for pioneering Trash Art and <a href=""https://twitter.com/robnessofficial/status/1414674121468694528"" >burning a CryptoPunk in July 2021</a>.   ""This can actually cause a bit of change in the world.""    ROBNESS   Instead, Robness chose to lean into all the positives of a larger light shining on the space.""Right after the Beeple sale I knew it was gonna happen. That was a watershed moment, good or bad. I'd say good though, because if you really look at it, every digital artist on the planet woke up and realised that they didn't have to create some vision for somebody else.""  Beyond personal the benefit of being able to share his work as NFTs, Robness has seen friends of his from the all the way back to his early days find success themselves, the likes of which could never have been possible without the technology. ""My buddies like <a href=""https://twitter.com/carlosmarcialt"">Carlos Marcial</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/money_alotta"">Alotta Money</a>, they're all from different parts of the planet.

A seasoned advocate for the opportunities that web3 can bring, the painter and digital artist sits with Nina Knaack Knaack to discuss finding the next step in generative art and creating a space for every emotion.",Fri Feb 17 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Ai-2; Digital-Art; Paintings-2; The-Netherlands; Europe,Nina Knaack," Rutger van der Tas has never adhered to conceptual norms in his creative process. Instead, the Dutch artist allows himself to be swept away in the flow of creation, finding liberation in the act of art-making, especially during trying times. Rutger first began drawing and painting at a young age, later joining a design academy before he realised that it was an ill-fit; he was not willing to follow a set of prescribed guidelines when it came to art, but instead sought to communicate through his own, inimitable artistic language. ""I have always been intrigued by combinations of shapes and hues, and bringing them together to make something that speaks to the human experience, though often distorted,"" he says. In this perpetual dance, Rutger creates his own rules, shaping an ever-evolving landscape with each (digital) brushstroke. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1022px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1022px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63ef92b99b06b629a2da38c2_Screenshot%202023-02-17%20at%2014.43.45.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/'held-myself-up-to-the-light'-9949"" > Held Myself up to the Light </a> , by Rutger van der Tas. </figcaption></figure> Rutger's teenage years were defined by bending the strictures of society, a pursuit that only intensified after the loss of his younger sister.""All I did was escape reality,"" he recalls,""drawing, painting, smoking, drinking, and immersing myself in the music of Radiohead and Nirvana. I was unfit for a life of routine."" Rutger decided to take himself to the other side of the world, funding travels across Australia with odd jobs. He returned to learn that his childhood home had been sold, and found himself illegally squatting with friends in Amsterdam.   ""I was making physical copies of works that were born digitally.""    Rutger van der Tas   He started, for the second time, as a student at the Rietveld Art Academy but, even there, he was still twisting societal constraints. He dropped out after half a year, living without direction until he met his future wife at the age of 24. A year later, they were living together, and Rutger's life began to take direction. With the arrival of fatherhood in his late-twenties, his perspective shifted once again. He returned to the academy, balancing his studies with a day job in healthcare and the responsibilities of family life. After five tough years of pouring himself into his art, Rutger finally earned his degree.  Rutger's studies at the academy introduced him to myriad modes of creation. Now he works with both the digital and physical, his sketches numbering in the thousands.""I create shapes that are both human and machine-like,"" he explains.""They may appear distorted, but they are part of an ongoing process. Each fragment holds its own identity in that moment, but can transform into something new as time shifts perspective and opens up new possibilities.""  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:930px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""930px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63ef8e58ba899bd6e5ed97ef_Screenshot%202023-02-17%20at%2014.25.16.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/connect-me.-34131"" > Connect me, </a>  by Rutger van der Tas. </figcaption></figure> Rutger does not seek to tell a story through his art, but rather, provides the raw materials for the viewer to craft their own narratives.""I hope that those who view my art discover, see, and process what they will,"" he says.""It is their own tale that I wish to inspire, as well as a form of therapy.""  Rutger was a visionary when it came to adopting blockchain technology: he accepted Bitcoin as payment for his paintings as early as 2015, and soon added Ethereum to his list of accepted currencies. In 2018, he even entertained the idea of creating a platform for artists to mint their work, only to discover the""roadblocks of code"" that would be required to do so. He abandoned the idea when he realised that the task of building a platform like OpenSea would have taken too much time away from his art.""Up until that point,"" he reflects,""I was printing my digital collages, making physical copies of works that were born digitally.""  Embracing the advent of NFTs, Rutger made his entrance into the digital realm of art on SuperRare in May 2019. He soon found himself connecting and collaborating with like-minded artists, such as Matt Kane, Coldie, and Sarah Zucker. And then, at the beginning of 2020, he received a call from Conlan Rios, the founder of Async.art, inviting him to collaborate on the first work for the Async platform. Rutger was quick to seize the opportunity. ""Everything just fell into place. I have always been drawn to creating layered art, both physically and digitally, because it keeps my workflow open to new discoveries along the way,"" he explains, noting how Async's platform empowered him to create and distribute generative art that was digital from start to finish.""With the Master+Layer setup' and, later, the Blueprint option', I was now able to mint generative art without writing a single line of code, adding an entirely new depth and dimension to my collections  something I had unknowingly been searching for all along."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1738px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1738px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63ef8f8699c30f0414bd47ba_ezgif.com-crop.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/'guy-with-a-pearl-earring'-6475"" > Guy with a Pearl Earring </a> , by Rutger van der Tas. </figcaption></figure> This idea of bringing all the previously lost' layers of his work to life was a revelation for Rutger.""Creating my work is like an ever-expanding cycle of reusing fragments,"" he says.""I piece together past and future discoveries in the present moment, constantly listening, looking, and experimenting with new combinations. Everything I create builds upon the last thing, creating a slightly different universe each time.""    ""I aim to create a space for all emotions.""    Rutger van der Tas   Although Rutger conjures up imaginary worlds through his art, his work is also a reflection of our own world and the human experiences within it. The softness of paint, combined with the sharp lines drawn on an iPad, showcase the contradictions and layering in life.""My ultimate goal is for the viewer to explore the different layers I have created across multiple collections,"" he explains,""and have a continuously surprising and somewhat (dis)comforting journey.""  Rutger's art can be intrusive and intense, a deliberate choice to raise awareness about mental instability.""I aim to create a space for all emotions. It's okay to feel what you are feeling. Psychological instability should not be a taboo, but rather something we must address and talk about. It is a part of our daily lives, in one way or another. There is always a dark side, but acknowledging it is the key to enlightenment and finding our way through."" ",2133

Indeed, it is what brought him to photography in the first place; Sammya was first inspired to experiment with the medium whilst travelling for work. He really dived into his craft, however, upon returning to his home city of Calcutta. ""I thought I should start with my home city, where I was born and brought up,"" he explains.""I wanted to see what stories I could bring out in my daily life. I went outside almost every day, early in the morning before my office hours started, to see what my city looked like in the rising hours of the day.""  Sammya's love of photography continued to blossom as he honed his skills. But he also had the desire to be part of a larger community. Eventually, he took the initiative to build one himself, comprising local people who shared his passion, and decided to create the Instagram account, Calcutta Instagrammers. Now exceeding 135,000 followers, the platform has become a major hub for local photographers, and a repository for thousands of images that paint a vivid story of the city. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/638a36f2e1c2984f5a723fdf_61JibiEtfh5I1P_ButHY71tjg2fXaXGzLPuLYQM8PSG27DnLSgtYepYtPkGi2Tmr5AWEPVhk6NhNFu19U3rAdjyT7coKudqSaUMZ3tn95BLgx0wP6TSkxUY3vGgj1JUIfNRXIycpJiccWGdGhQxO-1fqo4btpHMyq3k_V2fhZlCVPVGN9IaWXuZgSKna.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Sammya's photograph,  <a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x9b0f3d8ff3ecdbf68fad4a613e42be764b0b07cc/10"" > Floating dreams </a> , depicts locals revelling in the flooded streets of North Calcutta. </figcaption></figure> Although impassioned by the craft, it would take Sammya about four years of practice before he finally settled on his signature style.""In 2014, I got the chance to exhibit one of my works in Calcutta,"" he recalls.""That exhibition was curated by Raghu Rai, the photographer and photojournalist. I got a lot of positive feedback about the kind of work that I'd been doing, so storytelling through street photography has pretty much been my favourite genre of photography since then.""  ""It makes you bring the extraordinary out of the ordinary.""    Sammya Brata   But that feedback was not the only reason that Sammya decided to make street photography his bread and butter: it is a style that has piqued his curiosity and fortified his ambition for several reasons.  ""Street photography is mysterious to me,"" he says.""It brings out certain thought processes that allow me to observe and document the things that usually go unnoticed in our day-to-day lives. ""As a street photographer, hitting the shutter is the least important part. What is most important is observation, the way you anticipate a moment that is going to happen. I think most street photography work actually happens in your mind. It makes you bring the extraordinary out of the ordinary."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1108px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1108px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/638a36f397b3e029c6828405_pI4YbgrBwab9fna4Th2V-SM7xBV9IrWy8Fh16i1qy5kGjzyjXQi_mb2IqYgCZwSDcOb4JjRXi9nNGy-YbnSjDYTR_LGrmCIljbHRN3PpyDe_cR_iNQDPd0owM65lQMdVNOM78ZMFGXMDX9JQOaVPJ5e9DCmHeDlsXXD_sKUdCl206CRuoF0hJVMmUz6o.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Sammya Brata's  <a href=""https://foundation.app/@Deckle_Edge/foundation/131406"" > The Exuberance of Childhood </a> , displaying a carefree child seated in a rickshaw amidst a monsoon downpour; photographed in Mumbai. </figcaption></figure> Like many others, Sammya was deterred from pursuing a full-time career in photography for the lack of examples paving the way. He saw no street photographers making profitable careers from their niche.""I've always wanted to do photography full-time; there's no doubt about that,"" he says.""But I have not seen street photographers making a huge living out of their work. It's not commercial.""  Another element that kept Sammya erring on the hobbyist side of his art was the fear of losing what made the craft so important to him in the first place.""One more reason is that, you know, when you are shooting your heart out, you're expressing yourself to the fullest. But if you do it professionally, you are bound by a client brief, right? So I was sceptical about whether or not that love would still remain.""  NFTs came to provide a solution to both of those issues.""I heard about NFTs when some of my friends started migrating from Instagram to Twitter,"" he reveals, adding that the move occurred as a result of his platform becoming inundated with Instagram Reels.""That's when I started following exactly what was happening in the crypto space.""  Diving into conversations about NFTs on Twitter and Clubhouse, Sammya was soon hooked. He immediately saw the potential of the technology to expand the collector base for his art, especially in comparison to the other avenues available to photographers.  From Sammya's perspective, Instagram's large and diverse consumer base was hardly any benefit at all to artists when it came to actually turning views and likes into income. Indeed, that inequitable relationship between creators that depend on a platform's audience and the platforms that depend on creators' content is one of the biggest factors that the early crypto art movement has sought to address. Although artists may still be sharing their work on a web2 platform, typically Twitter, they're doing so with an audience who is much more likely to compensate them for their art.  ""With web3, artists have managed to connect to art enthusiasts specifically.""  Given that Sammya's artistic pursuits have existed independent of pressure to find a source of income, it makes sense that he highlights the cultural impact that crypto art has had, in lieu of its <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/patrick-amadon"">much discussed</a> financial ramifications.""The intermingling of cultures has been a great possibility, and sales and getting traction has nothing to do with it. It is pure human connection, a connection which has now crossed all the borders, and now we are talking real art.""   Indeed, if Sammya had a specific artistic statement, it would centre centres around bringing little-seen Indian culture onto the blockchain. He is currently working on a book, telling the stories and sharing the images of India's hidden cultural festivals. The ones that""are not anywhere on the internet."" His ultimate goal is for the contents of the book to be immortalised on the blockchain at some point in the future, in alignment with <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/decentralised-storage"">other movements</a> to permanently record cultural traditions onchain.  As far as opinions on the NFT art scene go, however, Sammya is largely alone in his convictions amongst his Indian peers.""It's pretty sad,"" he reflects.""I don't know what the reason is. It's probably the fact that it's a long-term race: it's not that you will enter and immediately taste success, and understanding the dynamics of how web3 works is not that easy. Penetration of NFTs has been really poor."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/638a5f31ce427a8600b96b7c_yep.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Sammya Brata's  <a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/77880343441441824581090406099038781538338001840329207874185158523646455578625""> PILLARS </a> , showing four Gomira folk dancers from the Kushmandi district of North Dinajpur, West Bengal. </figcaption></figure> Sammya feels that India's strong tradition of showcasing the work of local artists has meant that NFTs have not been as well-received as they have in other nations; there simply has been less of a need. But he suggests that showcasing this art via blockchain is particularly useful.""I hope that this changes in the next year. I'm planning to host a few physical workshops in some popular venues. I want to invite college students, involve schools, and include senior photographers, and let's hope that the scenario changes, because we really want the local culture to come over to the blockchain.""  One such event is an exhibition that Sammya is planning for this December in Calcutta, where physical art and digital art will be on display in the same place. He hopes that artists and enthusiasts alike will come together to learn about the potentials of this new artistic frontier.  For Sammya, who has enjoyed his own fair share of success when it comes to sales, it serves artists well to invest their time into the community and stay consistent. He never thought that he would be making the sales that he has, and he knows firsthand the pressure that artists can feel as they strive towards that first sale. ""I think that if you do things right, you will attract people not just to your pictures, but also to your tweets, and you will make a strong portfolio for yourself. This will give you the potential to make sales and establish yourself. It could be fast at times, it could be slow at times, but you will eventually make those sales."" ",2867
How Service DAOs are rewiring the traditional agency,service daos traditional agency,Wed Dec 28 2022 21:57:56,Service DAOs present a new opportunity for professionals to collaborate beyond the traditional agency or partnership. Jason Levin explores those leveraging web3 to disrupt the traditional economy and pieces together the roadmap for those trying to do the same.,Thu Dec 29 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Communities-built,Service-Daos; Daos,Jason," Entrepreneurs and professionals disrupting industries with new models of service provision is not a new phenomena. The impact of web3 is what decentralisation brings to the table. Typically made up of individuals who unite to profit from their common skills, service DAOs represent a new model of collaboration made possible only by blockchain.  In more ways than not, service DAOs are similar to traditional agencies, consultants, or other short-term service providers. The main distinction is that there is no hierarchy or central authority. Instead, every member of the DAO owns a share of the pie through the use of a shared token, creating a sense of incentive alignment that is unavailable to most employees and more reminiscent of traditional partnership structures that most individuals lack access to.  There are many different service DAOs operating today, each with its own unique focus, from marketing to cybersecurity. In being more incentivising than an agency and more accessible than a traditional partnership, it is likely that we will see an increasing number of service DAOs being formed to offer services  and doing so with talent and rates that are competitive with existing service providers.  Myosin  Named after the protein that powers muscle cells, <a href=""https://myosin.xyz/"" >Myosin</a> is a marketing DAO that works with both web2 and web3 companies on their acquisition strategies. ""You can't simply push your ads into the ether and hope that they'll find users,"" <a href=""https://www.myosin.xyz/latest/the-state-of-web3-marketing"" >writes</a> Myosin founder Blake Kim.""Rather you need to focus on building a strong community, content, and partnerships pipeline that create a strong gravitational pull, and use paid marketing to amplify your gravity.""  Most growth marketers are either in-house or work in an agency model, but Myosin is a DAO with multiple guilds each for different purposes: content, strategy, product, and more. They're in Seed Club's prestigious DAO accelerator and have done work with gaming platform EveryRealm and the web3 messaging platform Notifi. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1500px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1500px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63acbbd9268d181643736657_tz8TU79AlMfXG3BQzEEqF1TadmY-NFj0_B3sPU2qpy-PFuh2dwR3pkBYwlVjKvW3a_jn2QXiJPkajrjisOSnhmHdtITE6nw8-9prwfse7J7B-p116Nhclda4FyYVOgNsma6au8k8HiGd4fdXUjhl6QGt6T8u3XtFrozDuxbRi42cER5y55wI9Y8aTHtWFw.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption><em>Myosin is a marketing service DAO leveraging smart contracts to outcompete traditional agencies. </figcaption></figure> Founded by veteran growth marketers Blake Kim and Simon Yi, Myosin is a well-rounded DAO that offers services across all fields of growth marketing ranging from running a project's Discord to doing their paid ads. On top of servicing other companies, Myosin is using its DAO treasury to build digital products ranging from growth playbooks to SaaS products.  For each project, 75% of revenues go to the project contributor(s), 15% go to the DAO treasury, and 10% go to the referrer. This ensures incentives to foster collaborative growth as well as individual quality output.  On the face of it, Myosin looks similar to a traditional marketing agency. But it differs in leveraging smart contracts to automate away much of the hierarchy and middle-management that create overheads for agencies. In its place are frictionless incentives that encourage all members to accelerate Myosin's growth.  It is true that hierarchy and management can add to an organisation, but Myosin's thesis is that smart contracts allow them to capture the lift without adding the weight. Whether they succeed or not, they will raise the bar by outcompeting lesser agencies which fail to make the most of management whilst suffering under its overheads.  Code4rena  Code4rena is one of the leading DAOs in web3 security, with clients including OpenSea, SushiSwap, and ENS, amongst others. Most big tech companies have bug bounties: they pay white-hat hackers, often lucratively, to find bugs in their software. According to hacker website <a href=""https://geekflare.com/tech-companies-bug-bounty-programs/"" >Geekflare</a>, five-figure bounties are common in the industry, whilst those at Apple, Microsoft, and Samsung can reach $1 million.  Code4rena brings a layer of organisation to previously individual white-hat hackers, hosting audit contests often with pot sizes exceeding $50,000.

Rather than security engineers auditing published code, Code4rena now facilitates audits of private code focused on stealth startups, NFT launches, companies with closely-held IP, and anyone concerned about having their code hacked before they launch.  Code4rena place themselves at a middle ground between individual bug bounty hunters and agency-led code audits. As with Myosin, they use smart contracts to cut out constraints that limit the service provided by traditional audits. But in addition, they are a valuable alternative for cybersecurity specialists who might otherwise only work alone.  BanklessDAO  Everyone has heard of the media outlet  Bankless , but most are unaware of <a href=""https://www.bankless.community/"" >BanklessDAO</a>. Their mission is to build a media and social DAO that onboards 1 billion people into crypto.  In contrast to Myosin and Code4rena who open themselves up to a range of clients, BanklessDAO is focused primarily on servicing Bankless, the company. The DAO was founded by Bankless founders David Hoffman and Ryan Sean Adams when they airdropped 35,000 BANK tokens to each Bankless premium subscriber. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1500px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1500px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63acbbd9ce1c7d735efa418b_Uu85fPR4LYjcQrXn7Q0H5bYcDoTjxw408KmTicyUZlgTPq20vsMfxj3bf1_eP5bZJWA1AV5yL5Ucr-05Ir08f_Ibvwt9RdUf5xLUJc2AEHIwopjH-cg8qK-1Eoelf0V9VElUnDPURGa4Xa_kG2j2ePPAmyaQWpjYk3lNDeFS-y2TIgkGGoM-FjNSD3TOGQ.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > BanklessDAO provides services to Bankless, the media organisation, indicating how traditionally-structured organisations can use service DAOs. </figcaption></figure> From there, it blossomed into a community with multiple guilds that help further the Bankless mission as well as other related web3 projects.

This passion has driven an impressive career, not only in terms of a wide-ranging CV, but through a true commitment to community building and diversity. Sian has worked with everyone from Palm NFT Studio to Cool Cats to Magic leap, alongside running a media company of her own, The BlkChain (pronounced black chain'). But her journey in web3 started with cutting her teeth in web2, or at least the blockchain' of that: the smartphone. ""The iPhone came out and I was convinced that mobile would change everything: the way we communicate, the way we do business, everything,"" she explains, recalling her decision to found Kollective, her mobile design agency, in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2010.""I wanted to lean into that work and see how far the technology could take us. Back then it was quite an auspicious thing to do as a non-technical person, to decide to start a software development company.""  Even then, her passion for community was clear  she named it Kollective Mobile to underline that it was a passionate collaboration, comprising people coming together with a shared goal of exploring the mobile landscape.   ""I was convinced that mobile would change everything.""    Sian Morson   While she describes Kollective as""the one, a big constant in my life,"" it also was the start of her entrepreneurial journey.""I've always said, wherever I see a gap, I'll just try to fill it."" She continued to see gaps in markets and come up with creative ways to fill them, before moving into venture capital, where she spent most of her time at the culture-focused VC Cross Culture Ventures.  Continuing to play her role at the intersection of culture and technology, this time in an Entrepreneur-in-Residence role that she defined for herself, she seized the opportunity to give attention and support to those often ignored in the funding arena.""I'd never raised any VC money, but I was very much aware that people that looked like me were not getting as much venture capital as other people.

In blockchain, she sees the potential to circumvent  or steamroll  some of those hurdles, in venture capital and beyond. Though realistic about how much web3 needs to evolve, she speaks with obvious excitement and passion about the opportunity to circumvent embedded bias and level the playing field. ""What I love about the blockchain and where I see possibility is in things like smart contracts, which remove the human element and remove the potential discrimination that humans tend to bring,"" she explains.""I love that it's permissionless.""  But in order to achieve that, we need the right inputs in web3, and to achieve that, the space needs to become a home for more diverse voices. Accordingly, she's become an onboarder, a conduit for family and friends. ""What I understand is that people need to feel safe to ask questions about things that are quite daunting to them,"" she says.""The first thing that I try to do is to create a safe space. I tell my girlfriends, let's jump on a Zoom, grab a glass of wine (or a bottle!), and let's just chat about it'.""  But onboarding friends to web3 and elevating the diverse voices already in the space was just the start.""As I started to look around [in NFTs], I wasn't seeing art from people like me.

She decided that the role of elevating female, BIPOC, and LGBTQ artists was a new space that she wanted to grow, and created her own outlet: The BlkChain. Pronounced The Black Chain', what began as a simple newsletter has become a home for newcomers and aficionados alike, with 10,000 subscribers.""I'm really proud of what I've been able to do with The BlkChain to elevate the work of women, BIPOC, and LGBTQ folks in the space,"" she explains.""It is one of the things that I'm most proud of."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1529px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1529px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/639b05502342743827042b08_cyberyuyu.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > The Blk Chain exists, in Sian's words,""to elevate the work of women, BIPOC, and LGBTQ folks in the space.""

That comes from years spent explaining tech, whether to her girlfriends or to venture capital colleagues, in terms of the impact. One of the biggest factors in this respect, she explains, is web3's community orientation. That is a particularly significant mindset-shift for brands, for whom""everyone is either a customer or a potential customer"".  As Sian has seen, communities in web3 expect more.""I like to say that communities in web3 are more entitled. They're more entitled than anyone I've ever seen! That's because there's a real sense of belonging: They are literally invested in the success of this project.""   ""I think that brands need to internally prepare for building community.""    Sian Morson   She rightfully criticises the idea that""community"" is something brands can just write off to their marketing department. More often than not, she explains, that creates a superficial veneer, rather than really finding an authentic way to integrate a company's fans into how that organisation, to which they are more loyal than anyone else, actually works. ""I think that brands need to internally prepare for building community, and then externally prepare for cultivating a community. It's not a monolith, it's a living, breathing organism that consists of a lot of different people. And you have to reach every single one of those people and help them to engage with the brand."" She's clear that there is no one-size fits all approach  but she does see some groups leading the way. ""I like what Zora is doing. I think they're great as a platform, they're great as a protocol. They're fantastic. And then when you add the cultural aspect, Zoratopia,"" she explains,""you have this sort of travelling cultural event that they've built upon everything else, I love that.""  What energises Sian is the convergence of tech, tools, and the human touch  that element of authentic connection. Zora provides all of that: developers can build on the Zora protocol, artists can create with the Zora product, and anyone can appreciate the output of both groups at Zoratopia.""You go to a Zorotopia, whether it's at SXSW, NFT Oakland or even recently at Art Basel. You're seeing music, you're seeing artwork, and everything comes together into this wonderful sort of cornucopia of culture.""   ""People want their voices to be heard.""    Sian Morson   Whilst there is never one right answer for community building, it often seems to begin with incorporating the voices of the community into the creative process.""leaning into co-creation is going to be key. And I think that co-creation will differ for every brand,"" she says.""People want their voices to be heard, and if you are creating a product, they want to tell you what this should be or how it should meet their needs.""  Coming from entrepreneurship, Sian's transition into web3 has been incredibly smooth  because her motivation and focus are consistent in every arena she works in.""I think the two threads that I could find are championing diversity and communities,"" she says. ""It is really wonderful to look back and see that consistency. You don't see it while you're in it, but you stop for a moment and you're like,  Oh, yeah, that makes sense.'  It's my driving force, really."" ",2560

Empowered by web3, he is embracing the decentralised, permissionless, and immutable nature of the blockchain to mount a powerful, ongoing critique against censorship.  Although Slimesunday's irreverent approach to themes spanning drug culture and the erotic has catapulted him into the list of <a href="""" >top 10 grossing artists</a> in the NFT space, his current situation couldn't be more different from the one he faced only a couple of years ago.  ""Slimesunday started because I felt an extreme compulsion to just create things,"" he tells Culture3 in an exclusive interview.""At first it was very difficult to get by as an artist. I was living paycheck to paycheck, I took on unfulfilling freelancing jobs, and even worked overnight shifts on an ambulance"".   ""All that work has since been removed from every social media platform I have been a part of.""    Slimesunday   Self-taught, Mike began his artistic journey over a decade ago with a name inspired by Eminem's classic,  The Real Slim Shady . He initially took to replicating digital pieces that spoke to him, trying to find his own style and refine his technique.""The first five years were extremely experimental. It was mainly a massive learning phase and I spent most of my time messing with different software."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/631a4c6f39ce8f572e78951f_Bloons.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/bloons-14654""> Bloons </a> , by Slimesunday.""Over the course of my career, many of my artworks have been censored from my social media portfolios for explicit content violations."" </figcaption></figure> His commitment, curiosity, and practice paid off. Over time, Mike honed his skills and developed the signature style that would come to characterise his later works, eventually becoming sought after to collaborate with Grammy award-winning artists like Lana Del Rey, Katy Perry, J. Cole, and J Balvin.  But in 2020, crisis hit. As the world screeched to a halt in a bid to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, so did Mike's career.""I was hurting for income, since no artists were touring"", he recalls, a fate suffered by artists <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/violetta-zironi"">across the globe</a>. Mike's decision to dedicate himself fully to his art had been driven by a deep creative urge; a leap of creative faith into the unknown. It was friend and world-renowned DJ, Justin Lau (aka 3LAU), who suggested NFTs as a solution to the precarity that Mike was facing as an artist in the midst of the pandemic.  And so Slimesunday's initiation as a creator on the blockchain was as one half of <a href=""https://www.ssx3lau.art/"">SSX3LAU</a>, a collaborative project with 3LAU whose mission was to""explore the intersection of digital art, dance music, and distributed ledger."" Their genesis project, <a href=""https://www.ssx3lau.art/arraycollection""> the Array Collection </a>, was an instant sell-out.""The response to the work we released was amazing,"" Mike shares, adding that he couldn't help but build on its success.""The entire space felt like the beginning of something massive"". <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1092px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1092px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/631a4a3560e4924df1e05cc1_Slimeshop%2C%202022.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Slimesunday is making collage collaborative with his new initiative in partnership with OpenSea,  <a href=""https://slimeshop.slimesunday.com/""> SLIMESHOP </a> . </figcaption></figure> But beyond attaining a level of financial success that was previously unthinkable, his transition to blockchain has opened up a whole new world of artistic possibilities.""The level of innovation I have seen here in the past few years has been mind-blowing and this is what pushes me to keep building.""  Driving much of that innovation, he says, are the human connections facilitated by the peer-to-peer nature of the blockchain,""Before NFTs, the community aspect to art was never at the forefront of my thoughts."" Like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/patrick-amadon"">other artists</a>, he was creating just because it was what he loved doing.""I was creating individual artworks with no intention of ever selling them."" Enthused, he explains,""NFTs brought me a lot closer to the people who enjoy my work. I have conversations with collectors and have formed many new friendships.""  It is this access to collectors and the ability to build cohesive communities that forms an important counterweight to the centralised dominance of Big Tech. As an artist whose work explores themes of sexuality and the female-presenting form, Slimesunday regularly confronts the limits of top-down community guidelines. Of all the artforms with which he has experimented, Mike confesses that collage is the one he""really just fell in love with."" Yet it was his collages and the surreal juxtapositions they propose between the erotic and the mundane that first saw his account get flagged for content violations. ""I started experimenting more with analogue techniques,"" he explains.""I got myself a scanner and started going to thrift shops looking for old magazines and items I could use. That is really where I hit that aha moment, and I think this is when the majority of my best work was made. All that work has since been removed from every social media platform I have been a part of.""  Rather than be beaten back by an algorithm that <a href=""https://hyperallergic.com/673311/facebook-censoring-of-womens-bodies-is-nipocrisy/"">discriminates against women's bodies</a>, Slimesunday is leveraging blockchain to double down on his provocative style. His  What the Fork  collection, presented at Phillips Auction House last year, became""all about censorship."" He shares,""I was so fed up with being censored that I made it a major topic of conversation throughout my work."" The collection harnesses smart contract technology in creative ways as a defiant gesture of protest. In one collage, Growth, a segment on the top layer is removed any time Slimesunday's work is removed or censored, which reveals the explicit content lying underneath. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:900px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""900px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/631a502171245c67dbbbff6d_g.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x3c7503bd7d66c15e13cbc42953436e598d37c792/4""> Growth </a> , by Slimesunday, evolves as the American artist's work is censored on web2 social media. </figcaption></figure> Slimesunday's most recent collection,  SLIMESHOP , provides yet another example of the medium as the message. A true first of its kind, Slimesunday has partnered with OpenSea to create a tool that allows collectors to fully immerse themselves in the collage experience, layering and remixing a set of portraits, backgrounds, and stickers that the artist has created and collated over an eight-month period.""The digital experience we have created with  SLIMESHOP  would not have been possible a few years back,"" he explains, adding,""we are turning collectors into artists and they will be integral to the completion of the final artworks.""  Over a century ago, Pablo Picasso and George Braque's innovative use of collage served to destabilise the notion of the artist-genius and push the boundaries of what was traditionally considered art'. By taking this one step further through the blockchain, Slimesunday situates himself at the next iteration of this critical tradition. Inspired by other artists contributing to the dialogue on this artistic philosophy, like <a href=""https://twitter.com/thingsandink"">Filip Hodas</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/victormosquera"">Victor Mosquera</a>, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/mad.dog.jones"">Mad Dog Jones</a>, Slimesunday has simple advice for the new artists seeking to grow into this space and take on the mantle:""make art for the love of it and eventually everything will fall into place.""

Spexi: building a fly-to-earn drone economy,spexi,Thu Dec 29 2022 10:04:11,"Bill Lakeland has long dreamt of building a network of drones to capture important earth imagery. He's using the blockchain to bring his vision to life. Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg dives into Spexigon, the fly-to-earn platform bringing a new model to the aerial imagery industry. ",Thu Dec 29 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Climate-Crisis; Use-Cases; Drones; Platforms,Randy Ginsburg," Bill Lakeland always opts for the birds-eye view. An expert aerial photographer, he has spent his career flying and coordinating planes to collect high-resolution imagery, playing a key role in capturing the images used in applications like Google Earth and Google Maps.  After recognising an opportunity in drone technology in 2017, the seasoned entrepreneur decided to pivot his career, founding <a href=""https://spexigeo.com/"" >Spexi Geospatial</a>, with a focus on drones instead of planes. Their software brings automated-piloting drones along app-planned flights, collecting imagery that can be used to create data and imagery products for third-party operations.  The goal? To build a network of drones and pilots to visually capture important areas of the globe, and create a database of high-resolution imagery. Specifically, a database that could be accessed by organisations for a variety of purposes, such as inspecting railways, roofs, roads, and other infrastructure, or monitoring natural resources like forests and rivers. With high-resolution imagery from drones, both individuals and organisations can make more informed decisions without having to physically visit a site, when often such visits are not possible. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63ad644ad4e30c578df1e761_4C7PF4Ln1CmhSd5EHy9uwHoFv0Cj-cxkGWLBwiBcyADfH2BKv0eHRVdNcwjNyn5MEFNZi7DR0OzPV1LFYJCByUeTsf7bMHHWz246Vw13VgwgmjAZorBdqkZieyqlG3XJirU7NoOHIr-VMQqzXnJweoYIrKhPb86-DGtGcspPBIEhcmbRUAK32OaOWDa-.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Spexi's original drone technology was intended, in part, to facilitate monitoring areas such as roofs and other infrastructure. </figcaption></figure> Innovation takes time, and reaching scale takes even longer. In 2017, the drone technology and regulatory environment were not advanced enough for Lakeland to establish his network as intended. Image quality was inconsistent, regulation was unclear, and there were simply not enough consumer drones on the market. Instead, Spexi pivoted towards self-piloted image capture, allowing people to take their own images to sell to third parties, but without the database and network structure to facilitate this at scale.  To bring his big vision to life, the team needed to answer one key question:  how do we incentivise and motivate drone pilots across the globe to fly regularly and capture imagery? To solve this, Bill turned to the blockchain. In 2021, the team launched<a href=""https://spexigon.com/"" > Spexigon</a>, a global fly-to-earn drone imagery platform designed to democratise geospatial data. ""We quickly identified the blockchain and tokenomics as a proven vehicle for the mass coordination and incentivisation of a group of people to put their efforts towards a common goal,"" says Adam Killam, VP of Marketing at Spexi.  Similarly to how Bitcoin rewards miners and Ethereum rewards stakers for supporting their networks, Spexigon plans to coordinate and incentivise pilots with its own utility token, creating a fly-to-earn economy sustained by the value it provides to organisations who leverage their drone imagery to make better decisions.  With this model, Spexigon hopes to establish both a community of pilots and a database of global imagery. Using Spexigon, organisations that require high-resolution imagery will no longer need to use their own drones or employ pilots. Instead, they'll simply search, purchase, or commission imagery via Spexigon. From there, data buyers can use a suite of tools to put the imagery to use.  However, Spexigon is in no rush to roll out its token, acknowledging the importance of timing, preparation, and matching supply and demand.  ""A lot of other projects have gone off the rails by creating all the supply but not matching the demand,"" says Adam, referring to the need to bring in organisations who want to buy drone imagery via Spexigon before opening up to public markets.""We hope to take a more balanced approach and build both at the same time.""  Another key area of focus has been the fragmentation of the drone industry itself. With the proliferation of consumer drones, there are now millions of pilots flying with varying levels of expertise, image quality, and regulation.  To combat this inconsistency, Spexigon will be compatible with one specific drone initially, the DJI Mavic Mini 2. The Mavic Mini 2 comes with 4k video resolution and is made by DJI, the Chinese manufacturer that <a href=""https://www.asiaperspective.com/china-thriving-drone-industry/"" >dominates 76%</a> of the world's consumer drone industry. The Shenzhen-based company was also placed on the US sanctions list <a href=""https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3180636/dod-releases-list-of-peoples-republic-of-china-prc-military-companies-in-accord/"" >last October</a> over suspected ties to the Chinese military, indicative of the headwinds that face the broader sector. (The drone can still be flown in the US, but not for government-related flights.)  In phase one, the flying will be controlled entirely by the Spexigon software, significantly lowering the barrier to entry for beginner pilots. The move will guarantee high-quality image capture, as well as ensuring that each drone is flown in the exact same way using a custom-built, geographic-specific flight plan generated by Spexigon itself. Still, this process isn't entirely automated. Humans will still need to launch the drone and monitor the airspace.   ""We want to make sure governments and businesses are making better decisions.""     Adam Killam, VP of marketing at Spexi   Fresh off a $5.5 million raise from a group of web3 and robotics companies including Protocol Labs (the web3 applied research lab behind <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/decentralised-storage"" >Filecoin and IPFS</a>), InDro Robotics (a drone research company), and Dapper Labs (the company behind the <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/flow"" >Flow</a> blockchain), Spexi is building out its platform and is hopeful that their technology can play a role in tackling some of the world's largest environmental issues, as well as providing a service for enterprise clients. ""With ultra-high resolution images of forests along the West Coast, we can use computer vision and AI to detect pockets of dry tinder that could potentially lead to wildfires,"" Adam explains.""This will allow us to prevent environmental destruction by assigning crews to clean up these areas. It could have a massive impact.""  And that impact stretches far beyond the immediate use cases themselves. A tool like Spexigon would let organisations avoid sending employees to far-flung locations, freeing up time and resources, and bringing vision to places where it is unsafe or impossible for humans to reach. For Adam, the purpose of Spexigon is clear:""at the end of the day, we want to make sure governments and businesses are making better decisions."" ",2038
Stepping across the Uncanny Valley with Shavonne Wong,stepping across the uncanny valley with shavonne wong,Mon Sep 12 2022 20:29:45,"After a decade in fashion photography, Shavonne Wong has dived deep into the world of 3D art, synthesising her skills and experience in fashion to create lifelike human models. She sits down with Clara Peh to reflect on how her digital practice has evolved in web3.",Mon Sep 12 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,3d-Art; Cgi; Fashion; Singapore; Asia,Clara," Featured in the likes of Vogue and Bloomberg, and gracing the billboards of Times Square in New York and Shibuya in Tokyo, Shavonne Wong's rapid rise is a testament to the many new doors that web3 has opened for digital creators. But more importantly, the popularity of her work is demonstrative of our eternal desire to see human figures and characters in the digital landscape.  Prior to web3, Shavonne had a decade-long career in fashion photography, which, to her, holds consistent parallels with the creativity that characterises her work today.""Unlike documentary or event photography which focus on capturing reality, fashion photography, to me, has always been about creating fantasy and selling a dream.""  In 2020, when the pandemic hit and strict lockdowns befell across the world, Shavonne moved from working on-set with human models to creating virtual models on her computer, speculating on the future of digital fashion and the growing need for ways to display clothing outside of the physical realm. She started her own virtual modelling agency where clients could book her CGI models to fashion their clothing.    ""Fashion photography, to me, has always been about creating fantasy and selling a dream.""    Shavonne Wong   Shavonne's virtual models are realistic and lifelike constructions, drawn from her large repository of reference photos comprising different faces and body types. Continuing her extensive experience of working with models in real life, Shavonne developed an interest in working with faces and looks that sit outside conventional beauty standards, challenging and expanding our notions of beauty. She places her models within different settings, much like in a traditional fashion shoot, to create uncanny and imaginative scenes. Her work continues to sell fantasies and dreams, but this time, without the constraints of gravity and the laws of physics.  Her <a href=""https://foundation.app/@shavonnewong/foundation/7419""> Lunah Moon </a> series was one of Shavonne's early forays into NFTs and is characteristic of her technical skill. Lunah Moon is an Asian woman with brown freckles across her cheeks, platinum white hair, and shimmery red lips. Red painted fishes with long, delicate tails swim across her face as she keeps still and holds her gaze straight ahead, inviting onlookers to meet her eyes and step into this imaginary scape alongside her. The slow blinking of Lunah Moon's eyes is eerily realistic, and is a gesture used across several of Shavonne's models, such as Lilium and Kin, introducing life and motion into her digital figures. Each work captures a lush scene, as if they had been lifted straight out of an editorial magazine. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/631f9542ad2684ede4aa9e83_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(3).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > An excerpt of  <a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/uplift-25511""> Lunah Moon </a> , by Shavonne Wong. </figcaption></figure> Building on her individual models, Shavonne began expanding her practice to create broader narratives and experiment with the possibilities of digital 3D.""I create whatever excites me. This could be a visual look I am going for, a new technique I have learnt, or perhaps a message I would like to bring across in my works,"" she says. In <a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/uplift-25511""> Uplift </a>, we see a short animation of a group of women of all races and body types gathered, lifting one another up to leap into the sky. Meanwhile, in <a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/weightlessness-31937""> Weightlessness </a>, three women are suspended in motion in mid-air. They pose as symbols of timeless beauty and grace, while the clouds shift rapidly behind them.  ç Love is Love  is Shavonne's most significant series so far, a generative project of 500 pieces. In each piece, two individuals stand close to each other in anticipation of a kiss. Collectors were invited to select the genders of the couple depicted in the edition they mint, an exercise Shavonne designed to enable the collector to see themselves reflected in their collected work and to emphasise that love is love, regardless of one's identity and preferences.  This dispersion of creative authority, reclaimed from corporations and clients, marks a huge distinction between NFT art and the traditional art world. Yet this power also brings greater responsibility for the entire workflow. NFT artists don't need a team, but learning to work solo is its own transition.""One of the biggest changes is moving from a team structure that is very collaborative to working alone,"" Shavonne says, explaining that the shift from commercial photography to creating her own work is itself significant. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/631f933ee516f9745342144a_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(2).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Shavonne's  <a href=""https://www.shavonnewong.art/projects/love-is-love""> Love is Love </a>  collection features 1000 different figures, allowing collectors to embed themselves into her art, and emphasising that love is love. </figcaption></figure> Previously, Shavonne would have been working with models, makeup and hair artists, stylists and others on the crew, all working collaboratively to complete a shoot. By contrast,""moving into 3D, there aren't many digital makeup artists yet, and the digital fashion scene is still small, so I have to take on roles that I previously never had."" Whilst the transition to a new medium has led her up a steep learning curve, Shavonne has quickly adapted and become one of the most well-recognised 3D model creators in web3.  Earlier this year, Shavonne collaborated with fellow Singaporean photographer, Lenne Chai, on a 3D photography project titled,  By Proxy . This marked Shavonne's first NFT project where we see her virtual models imposed on photographic images. Although she had previously experimented in combining both mediums through her modelling agency work, Shavonne's NFT art had been entirely digitally constructed up to this point.  By Proxy  brings us into the world of a virtual teenager as she enters adolescence. We watch her in different situations, sitting atop a slide in the playground, to lying on her bedroom floor, toying with something in her hands, to falling asleep and clutching her book bag on the train. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1920px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1920px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/631f8ff651a31b68001c9ea7_unnamed.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://quantum.art/collection/by-proxy""> All The Things She Said I </a> , by Shavonne Wong and Lenne Chai, from their  By Proxy  collection.  </figcaption></figure> Lenne's soft and dreamlike lens lets us bear witness to the girl's journey. Captured against everyday scenes and sights in Singapore, we watch her grow from a young child to a teenager, from sitting on her cartoon-themed bedsheets to drinking beers for the first time by the beach.   All the while, Shavonne's realistic but intentionally uncanny construction of the young girl's face reminds us that the story is fictitious; lifelike, but not quite real. In revealing the protagonist to be a digitally constructed model, her identity is obscured. She becomes a green screen onto which each of us can project our own memories and childhoods.  Moving forward, Shavonne will continue to create lifelike models in fantastical landscapes, allowing her artworks to act as prototypes for expanded imaginations in a virtual reality. As digital tools and processes continuously improve, she is taking more time to focus on levelling up her skills and improving her craft, with the aim of being able to create even more realistic and effective narratives. And with that, she takes us further across the uncanny valley of the humanoid. ",2405
How NFTs can empower the next generation of storytellers,storytelling nfts by akansha jain,Tue Oct 18 2022 19:24:30,"What makes humanity unique is our capacity for storytelling. NFTs add a fundamental new dimension to this ancient craft. By distributing IP ownership, web3 makes it possible for thousands of people to collaborate on building a story. Akansha Jain explores what makes the best stand out.",Thu Oct 20 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Storytelling,Nft; Jenkins-The-Valet; Omega-Runner; Renga; Opinion,Akansha-jain," Stories have the power to transform our everyday existence into immersive worlds, feelings, and ideas. Humans feel connection through stories. The reality is we are all storytellers from the very earliest days of our lives, and through it, we begin to learn the power of our own memory and imagination.  We preserve stories in forms like a book or a recording or a film. Many of them guide us on how to live lives, like religious texts or our nation's constitution. For centuries, we told stories orally, memorising complex narratives down the generations. But technology is transforming the way we tell stories.  Initially, television, film, and radio gave storytellers a diverse creative toolbox through which they could tell their tales. Subsequently, the internet gave everyone access not only to a seemingly endless library, but the tools to tell stories ourselves, mainly through our social media posts. Today, franchises like Marvel, Star Wars, and Harry Potter are a few of the most profitable franchises of all time; the video streaming industry is expected to be worth over <a href=""https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-video-streaming-market"">$300bn by 2030</a>. Why? Because we innately love stories and immersing ourselves in fantasies beyond the norm of our everyday lives.  NFTs can empower the next generation of storytellers.  Underneath the bad press, scams, and the JPEGs, there's a fundamental organising technology that makes NFTs special. Verifiably unique digital assets that cannot be directly replaced by another token, NFTs are how users own things on the internet. But the value of an NFT lies not in the scarcity of a particular trait, but in membership of a community which that NFT confers. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1080px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1080px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6351721b0d07215528451bfc_279888809_444144367514578_6995011052869244522_n.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://renga.app/vision"">Renga</a> is an excellent example of how creators can multiply the value of their art by tying it to a developed story.</figcaption></figure> Indeed, cryptoartists often struggle to find a market for their craft because scarcity tends to become valuable when it is connected to something more tangible. The purpose of the story is to get the audience to care about the JPEG, as well as the scarcity baked into the smart contract underneath, encouraging people to collect and engage rather than flip and trade.  Built around""sequential art, with a liberal use of page space and sparing use of dialogue,"" <a href=""https://renga.app/vision"">Renga</a> is an excellent example of how creators can multiply the value of their art by tying it to a developed story. The artworks, which blend 900 traits across the 10k collection, intentionally leave much to be interpreted, and the community is welcomed in to contribute narratives via 'Black Boxes', which let community members claim their own character from the Renga universe.  It is in this way that NFTs can empower the next generation of storytellers. But this shift is an evolution, not a revolution, and builds on what makes stories popular. First come the foundations, an intriguing plot and interesting characters  ultimately, immersive lore. When done best, it represents a core narrative that motivates fans to contribute their own ideas on the side. Fan fiction takes on enormous relevance. Jenkins the Valet has reached popular acclaim in no small part due to the depth of its lore, which began as one character in the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, but has gone on to cover a broad range of characters in a newly-imaged world, Azurbala:  With NFT storytelling, the mark of an excellent project is when its creators have designed an open-ended ecosystem like Azurbala, with characters and environments that allow fans to become community members and for members become collaborators, contributing their own ideas and vision. With NFTs verifying who has the rights to each contributing IP, all that's left is for the story to be written.  Jenkins' <a href=""https://www.jenkinsthevalet.com/bored-and-dangerous"">collaboration with</a> the New York Times bestselling author Neil Strauss is the furthest a storytelling NFT collection has gone so far in terms of writing quality: community members voted on the overarching narrative; Strauss applied his expertise to bring it all together.  These cultural and governance innovations open up the opportunity for stories to become communal again. Rather than going through a small group of people for every story to be told, every spin-off book or film adaption, every fan is able to contribute an idea and see it professionally delivered.   There's a huge range of extra media built on top of Harry Potter, but there's even more fan-fiction.

Inside the Sutuverse: 15 years in the making,sutuverse,Wed Aug 24 2022 19:49:10,"With Sony, Google, and deadmau5 collabs on his CV, Sutu is now taking his own project to a new level with NFTs. The Webby-awarded visual artist speaks to Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg about his plans to build the next big web3 IP set through AR and gaming.",Wed Aug 24 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Sutuverse; Games; Metaverse,Randy Ginsburg," There are thousands of artists and NFT founders, but few have the resume, talent, and creativity of Sutu. A naturally curious, Webby-award-winning artist and entrepreneur, Sutu has spent over fifteen years exploring his love for sci-fi and emerging technology through a combination of interactive design, animation, and storytelling.  Today, Sutu's work happens under the organisation EyeJack, the AR studio he co-founded with Lukasz Karluk in 2017. Since then, the pair have produced hundreds of AR activations for clients like Sony, Google, and Marvel. Sutu has also taken his talents to VR concerts, creating art for The Weeknd, Dillon Francis, Alison Wonderland, and more.  After following the rise of web3 and collaborating with deadmau5 on an early <a href=""https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/in-titan's-light-17270"" >SuperRare drop</a>, Sutu quickly realised the groundbreaking potential for creators.""It blew my mind,"" he tells me, adding that he hadn't seen successes like it, despite all his years working on digital projects.""I saw this huge paradigm shift in the creator economy and realised I needed to take this way more seriously. Then, I dove all the way in."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2021px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2021px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63074661fe62e7854edc70b9_ted.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Sutu spoke from the  <a href=""https://www.ted.com/speakers/stuart_sutu_campbell""> Ted Main Stage </a>  in 2020 about how metaverse technology can be used to create digital art that enhances and enriches our physical spaces. </figcaption></figure> Sutu began experimenting with NFTs in different styles and formats, gauging interest from his audience along the way. The response was positive. Over the next year, Sutu quickly amassed a large online following and built a loyal community of collectors around his initial work. He then began working on Neonz, web3-native IP that he hopes will define the metaverse era.  The first step? A collection of 10,000 psychedelic, retro-futurist <a href=""https://www.neonz.xyz/gallery"" >NFT avatars</a> to serve as an access key to a host of AR, VR, and browser experiences in the broader Sutuverse.  In typical fashion, Sutu was pushing the boundaries, making history with Neonz as the first 10,000 PFP collection to launch on the Tezos blockchain. In the wake of naysayers and sceptics, the project sold out in thirty minutes.   ""I saw this huge paradigm shift in the creator economy""    Sutu  ""That provided me an investment to explore and bring together everything I've been working on for the past fifteen years,"" he said.""Now I'm figuring out how to use it to create a property from the ground up and use it to shape our ideal vision of the metaverse.""  And explore he has.  What started as a PFP drop has now expanded into the broader <a href=""https://www.neonz.xyz/#sutuverse"" >Sutuverse</a>, consisting of two AR experiences, <a href=""https://www.neonz.xyz/neonz-signz"" >Signz</a> and <a href=""https://www.neonz.xyz/neonz-facez"" >Facez</a>, and <a href=""https://www.neonz.xyz/neonz-game"" >Circuit Breaker</a>, an upcoming browser-based speedrun blockchain game. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:45%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""45%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6307430304fd235f0160bd0a_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(10).gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Neonz #9716, from the 10k PFP collection on  <a href=""https://objkt.com/collection/neonz"" > Objkt </a> .

Within the last eight months, Sutu has brought two AR experiences to life, both of which run on the EyeJack mobile app.  The first, Signz, allows holders to display a 2D neon sign of their Neonz in the real world. Holders can also purchase <a href=""https://objkt.com/collection/KT1FkMRSsrqWXU88PEUuPsjuL9hSEq23R1vD"" >Lightfieldz</a>, additional utility tokens that cover real-world surfaces with trippy animations.  The second, Neonz Facez, a 3D facefilter that allows anyone to become a Neonz. Simply connect your wallet, scan a QR code and display your Neonz filter.  During an NFT exhibition at Superchief Gallery in Los Angeles, Neonz featured on a 75-inch screen with a phone mounter. Each time a viewer swiped their hand in front of their face, a different Neonz would activate. The installation was a hit and has since toured five different countries. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1919px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1919px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63073f75d226ae5ab3e16d12_Screenshot_1.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > How a Neonz Signz looks through an AR lens. </figcaption></figure> Pursuing his vision to build out greater, more immersive worlds, Sutu has now moved on to the next chapter of the Sutuverse: Circuit Breaker.  Circuit Breaker is a browser-based speedrun game filled with obstacles, corridors, moving platforms, and hidden dimensions. The game, which premiered last month at the Proof of People exhibition in London, is slated to launch online this September, kicking off with a grand tournament  "" Ready Player One-style.  Like many blockchain-based games, Circuit Breaker aims to solve an age-old problem within gaming: the one-sided value exchange between gamers and creators. For years, gamers have invested ample funds and hours into their favourite games, only to be left empty-handed when producers release new storylines, change the mechanics, or simply move onto the next hit.  By tokenising gaming assets on a blockchain, gamers can own, retain, and even benefit from their in-game performance. In the Sutuverse, players log in with their wallet, allowing their stats and assets to be tracked on the community leaderboard.  Once connected, Neonz holders will find a full-body 3D avatar that boasts unique in-game powers based on their Neonz traits. For example, Neonz avatars that are outfitted with gas masks are able to run through gas fields; those without masks are forced to slow down. Meanwhile, Lightfieldz holders will gain access to hidden dimensions, trippy shortcuts, and various in-game easter eggs. It's effectively DLC, but with resale value.  All players can also customise their Neonz game avatars through in-game NFT accessories, like elbow pads or knee pads, each of which hold specific performance-based utilities. In contrast to pay to win' games, where players receive an overwhelmingly unfair advantage through paying for certain perks, performance boosts in the Sutuverse can only be unlocked through the completion of in-game achievements  "" players are rewarded for playing, not for paying. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3936px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3936px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/630741f3dd17d134f1539c88_cbpop%20(1).jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Circuit Breaker exhibited at Proof of People in London (July 6-8) and could be played by attendees. </figcaption></figure> Indeed, if holders choose to sell their Neonz, all game performance and accessories can be sold along with the avatar; the best players command a higher price on the open market. Holders can also license the IP of their Neonz for various merch, media, and partnership endeavors.  For Sutu, these projects are only a smart part of his larger vision for building IP, perhaps the""Tron of the Metaverse"", living across multiple worlds and environments. The next step? Pitching a Neonz Hollywood film. ""The most exciting part about Circuit Breaker, and Neonz as a whole, is that the content and experience orbit around the NFT, a decentralised digital asset,"" says Sutu.""Platforms come and go, but when content is decentralised it can live on and evolve, and the holders of the NFT can come along with it.""

Defining herself simply as""a regular person"", Swickie exudes a warmth that others reserve only for good friends. Chatting to her for the first time offers a glimpse into how she has endeared herself to the many NFT and web3 communities that she is a part of, from sports to arts to OG collections.   Two words come to mind to describe Swickie when exploring her artistic output and brand work within web3: prolific and passionate across all kinds of topics.""People mostly see me as an artist but I think a lot of people see me as a connector in-between spaces and in between worlds within web3."" Laughing, she adds,""I exist in this weird little section of a Venn diagram. But that's where I've always wanted to be.""  In one of the many overlapping circles that make up Swickie's Venn diagram' is <a href=""https://www.swickie.io/bayc5273"">#TeamKiki</a>, the community that she and her partner, Peter Fang, have built around Bored Ape #5273. ""The thing that put me on the map probably is the ape"", she shares. It was Bored Ape Yacht Club's (BAYC) innovation to transfer intellectual property (IP) rights to holders that sparked Swickie's imagination, initiating a journey that would see Kiki feature in a special edition of <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/punks2kiki"">Punks Comic</a> and form collaborations with creators ranging from streetwear designer Dee Calvero to celebrated Los Angeles-based Street artist, Rich Uno.""I came from branding,"" Swickie explained, adding that she was energised by the challenge that came with the opportunity,""it was like, let's see how good at branding I really am.""   While Swickie's work with boutique brands, combined with her experience in film and television production, no doubt gave her an edge in positioning Kiki, it also gave her a unique perspective on how collective ownership on the blockchain is changing the fundamental chemistry of how people collaborate. ""Working in web2 branding, it was very clear to me that people weren't really listening to each other. There was not a lot of autonomy for the clients or for creative people to go out and do whatever it is that they want to do with their marketing."" By contrast,""what I love about web3 projects is how you're buying into a project which gives other people ownership so that they also care what happens to it.""  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ed376d3787747e94daf3b2_dc.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > One of the two hoodies being released by Dee Calvero and Swickie. </figcaption></figure> As a Latina, the personal implications of having direct access to collectors and potential collaborators are not lost on Swickie. To her, it's a question of flattening power dynamics.""The number one thing in web3 is how it allows so many people who were never able to access wealth and opportunities before to do so."" She adds,""it's crazy to me to look at what my life was ten years ago and look at it right now and just be like, we put up with so much because there was no other option."" One word that Swickie uses again and again to describe what she sees happening in web3 is 'empowerment'.""Back in web2, I was really timid and afraid to lose my job situation. And here it's like, you're not the boss of me. I'm paving my way. And your bad take is not going to derail my plans'.""  At the heart of it, Swickie's web3 story is one of unfolding rediscovery and reclamation; of her identity as a businesswoman and a Latina but also as an artist, a dreamer and a storyteller. As one might expect, Swickie's art is as eclectic as her interests. Spanning photography, digital painting, AI art, mixed media and animation, her collections weave through styles as diverse as SoCal neon pop, 90s glitch art, and architectural photography. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1920px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1920px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ed4074d38f94fcd4266646_Screenshot%20(412).png.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >Part of Swickie's Moonbeam oncyber gallery.</figcaption></figure> While she now embraces her identity as an artist, it hasn't always been this way. Swickie describes how she had""put to bed"" the idea of being an artist in her own right to instead focus her career on managing other creators. It wasn't until she began tentatively releasing her own art as NFTs  "" and saw her work snapped up by notable collectors  "" that something began to click.   <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/moonbeamcollection"">Moonbeam Collection</a>, a series of twenty digitally rendered astralscapes that capture visions from lucid dreams, was the first complete collection that Swickie minted on the blockchain. It sold out. <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/californiachroniclesvolume02"">California Chronicles</a>, a series of photos of the people and places that shaped her during road trips across lesser visited areas of California, followed suit. As appetite for Swickie's work grew, she was forced to confront her artistic talent.    ""I realised that drawing out my dreams really helped me figure out who I am.""    Swickie   But there was something deeper going on too. Amongst the vast expanse of the Californian desert, Swickie began to explore themes of reflection and resolution.""It was a lot of learning about myself, because there was like nothing to look at, you know? There's just a loneliness."" Her photos are a carefully-selected combination of significant places and people who made life-long impressions, all experiences that compelled her to take a portrait to commemorate that moment in time. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:5162px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""5162px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ed4549e345858083790275_California%20Chronicles%20%2327%20Opensea%20Swickie.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/99812094584801729532205219429101427717450179964468534049342191223084320555009""> California Chronicles #27 </a> , by Swickie. </figcaption></figure> Bringing the mystical depths of her dreams to life and sharing vulnerable moments captured on camera provided answers to the deep questions that Swickie had carried with her for years.""I came into this place trying to find out who I am, in the most literal and figurative sense that you could possibly think of. One of the questions I had was, am I even an artist'? Once I sold my first two pieces, I realised that drawing out my dreams really helped me figure out who I am.""  More recently, Swickie has been exploring storytelling through <a href=""https://foundation.app/collection/theapproach?sortOrder=DEFAULT&tab=description"">AI art</a> and""bringing NFTs irl"" through her <a href=""https://twitter.com/SpaceDustHQ"">Space Dust</a> project. She has big plans for Kiki who was recently signed to the web3-native agency, DYOR Management.""It's accelerating the plans that I have because I've got a team now instead of just me."" Enthusiastically, she adds,""there's also another thing, but I can't tell you yet because I haven't announced it. But that particular thing is super exciting to me because it's something that we did on our own."" There's more to come.  As someone who has personally undergone deep transformation through web3-facilitated community and art, Swickie is clear about how important this moment is for cultivating accessibility and onboarding historically marginalised communities; ""to women, I would say don't be afraid. There is support here. You can find people who are cool and will be your allies."" In a serious tone, she emphasises,""And it's important for people to be allies. If you can be, you should be.

" ""Art saved me in a really profound way""  culture, society, and femininity through the eyes of Tan-Tan",tan tan,Fri Aug 19 2022 14:41:30,"Tan-Tan is synthesising an entirely new style of art on web3. Indian-born and trained in the Flemish style, she speaks to Ola Kalejaye Kalejaye about overcoming imposter syndrome by developing her own style, how her feminism manifests in her art, and how an individual can change society.",Sat Aug 20 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Digital-Art; Anime,Ola Kalejaye,"  Skeptical.  Over the course of an hour-long interview, that is the word that the traditionally-trained painter turned digital artist, Tan-Tan uses most to describe herself.  Skeptical of society today; how it defines culture, or gender; of people's intentions, of the idea that anyone can change the world. Skeptical because of different challenges and situations that she has faced, ones that brought with them a healthy dose of existential crisis.  And yet, in the art that Tan-Tan both consumes and creates, there is a healthy dose of optimism. It is art that has allowed the Delhi-native to parse through the chaotic world around her. It is art, she says, that saved her. Now, as a digital artist riding the tides of the crypto-driven artistic renaissance, she is allowing the camaraderie and enthusiasm of today's online artist communities to wash away more of the cynicism. ""I was really introverted; I would just stay in my studio and paint for days. I feel like coming into NFTs I'm getting over that fact. The friendships and connections I've fostered have been really great: the NFT space made me gain a bit of faith back in humanity."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ff9b761e49f083bb8f0530_watching.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >  ""Know, then, thyself, presume not God to scan; // The proper study of mankind is man.""

""I was first introduced to animes and mangas really early on. I felt like it played a really important role for me as an artist and in my artistic journey. The fact that you can experience a lot of stories and a lot of characters has really appealed to me since I was a kid.""   ""For society to make sense of a piece, it needs to be tangible, almost be felt. And I feel that's what NFTs did.""    Tan-Tan   The epic scale and variety of storytelling of anime is a particularly notable influence on Tan-Tan, given how storytelling is a major part of both her artwork and the considerable context and <a href=""https://www.tan-tan-art.com/article"">world-building</a> that she puts into each piece.""Anime was kind of a life-altering experience for me. It puts you in a mindset that, at the end of the day, you are the hero. You might not change the world, but you are on a heroic journey."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1509px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1509px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ffb0da475adf060ba223c2_Eden.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > ""Beautiful surfaces without depth // Precious without truth // Are sensational // Not profound reflections.""  <a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1BKoqmvy8c9UUJ6NAznC4YBNDL7fAY7Uuk/20""> East of Eden </a> , by Tan-Tan. </figcaption></figure> Of course, equally important to Tan-Tan's artistic style is her background as a painter trained in the neoclassical school. As individual artists go, Tan-Tan notes the French artist of the same style, <a href=""https://artuk.org/discover/artists/bouguereau-william-adolphe-18251905"">William-Adolphe Bouguereau</a>, as a particularly important influence. Yet as much as Tan-Tan was inspired by the classical beauty of Bouguereau's work and the renaissance masters before him, those works induced somewhat of an imposter's syndrome for Tan-Tan. ""As I grew up, I was more introduced to Renaissance art. I went to New Zealand for some time and saw these amazing Renaissance paintings. And I felt so incomplete as an artist, just the idea that these masters could draw and paint like that, I felt inferior to them in every way, as an artist.""  Those feelings of inferiority impacted Tan-Tan's ability to fully express herself as an artist. By merely attempting to copy the masters, and subsequently feeling like her work couldn't come close, she felt as though she was""losing a lot of self-expression."" Ironically, she notes that a lack of artistic expression was a criticism widely levied in response to Bouguereau's work as well.  While his work did centre around an""academic style of painting"" that was more focused, for Tan-Tan, self-expression was the ultimate point of her artistic endeavors. It is in this need that the perfect synthesis of traditional and new, of classical and digital, was born. Through combining the skills from her traditional schooling with her grasp of digital techniques and a love for the manga style, Tan-Tan is able to find a more authentic expression of who she is. In her words, adding digital tools to her arsenal allowed her to experiment more and let her paintings""breathe"".  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:958px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""958px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ff9b05d94fbfb9ea2b5967_yixX7nsO_c1w3t2KNWuqZcQCf9mHWVDsHM8YgOARIpmkgfZTIue3axY7nh5LbwWrgyqfGeXmBWKsvSMg6Gyn7X3I6bqQwe6PaaOjW57bBrjPWAIAO8U-OeiT5wy8gaCfATkLkWQqWKKykBAstW0fzSY.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1BKoqmvy8c9UUJ6NAznC4YBNDL7fAY7Uuk/10""> Girl with a Pearl Earring </a>  is partly inspired by a quote from the 19th century American painter, Robert Henri:""Courage to go on developing this ability to see in nature the thing which charms you, and to express just that as fully and completely as you can."" </figcaption></figure> At the heart of Tan-Tan's stories are the ever-present manga-inspired heroes. These figures are where Tan-Tan's work most clearly and intentionally deviates from the work of the masters that inspire her. ""As I looked more into art history, I realised that there is a specific feminine that is depicted. It's not right or wrong; I would say it was the norm at the time. And I feel like speaking to my generation, and speaking in my time, the female figures that I want to portray just differ from how the classical masters used to portray them.""  As far as how Tan-Tan would portray her female figures, she sees the subjects of her work as a representation of Carl Jung's theory of Anima and Animus'.""It relates to what the psyche is: every female has a masculine part of their personality, and every male has a feminine part of their personality. My female figures represent the masculine in the feminine. The idea that there is no real distinction, and that it's just an amalgamation of your psyche, which has both.""  As a primarily digital artist, NFTs quickly made sense to Tan-Tan. Moreover, they offered far more than simply an avenue to sell art. They materialised digital art in a way that has shifted its perception in the eyes of millions. ""For society to make sense of a piece, it needs to be tangible, almost be felt. And I feel that's what NFTs did.""  Through connecting with other artists online  she highlights the community of artists on the Tezos blockchain where she mints all her work  she has the chance to have meaningful conversations about the art that she is passionate about and find new inspirations.  Such is the breadth of the NFT community that Tan-Tan has found a tight core of anime lovers within it, emphasised by the style's popularity in 1-of-1 artworks and generative avatar collections alike. Whatever the estimation of anime in the fine art world, its impact on global culture is undeniable, particularly the internet culture that is so inexorably intertwined with the NFT space.  Tan-Tan's perspective on art is wider and more inclusive  less pretentious, even  than the line taken by many attached to the institutionalised norms of the traditional fine art world. And it's certainly one that will align with many others in the NFT art space. ""I don't consider my Renaissance influences better than my manga or anime influences. They rank the same for me because they have enriched my life a lot, on the same level. So I feel it's not really a competition. Every person has their own journey and experiences and things that relate to them.""  It reflects the reality that, more often than not, artists of all different mediums and styles have found ways to connect with each other and find audiences  both large and niche  in web3. As will resonate with countless artists who create NFTs, Tan-Tan has often heard the opinions that digital art isn't""real art"". It was her art teacher who first tried to impose that restriction, but needless to say, Tan-Tan's view is completely different. It is representative of the broader movement, buttressed by the resilience of the NFT art market, for digital art to receive the recognition it deserves.  It is a change several decades in the making, and digital art's fight for status is far from over. But with time, the new artistic freedoms that artists like Tan-Tan can now explore, thanks to web3, could one day be the norm for digital artists. Fortunately, the weight of change does not fall on any one person. As long as artists and collectors in the NFT space continue to push for this new paradigm, the art world will continue to change; more and more artists will come into the space, and as they succeed, collectors will have to follow. ""No one needs to change the world, they just need to maybe change a bit of themselves and how they see the world. And maybe that might be a cause for a more integrated society."" ",2794
"Tania Rivilis seeks to answer a question we've all asked ourselves:""Who am I?""",tania rivilis,Wed Nov 02 2022 09:09:26,"Tania Rivilis' plywood portraiture explores the consciousness of the characters she paints, depicting our identities and the relations between them.

Tania Rivilis aims to answer this fundamental question through her art. While immersing myself in her NFT collections, I began to explore the broader notions of identity and purpose as well. Maybe I'm the subject of Tania's art piece, or perhaps my true self is trapped inside her paintings. Her work is reminiscent of the poet Emily Dickinson, who <a href=""https://poets.org/poem/im-nobody-who-are-you-260"">once wrote</a>""I'm Nobody! Who are you? / Are you  "" Nobody  "" too?""  Through a lens of coloured portraiture, Tania creates a romantic speculation on the human body, connectivity, and our relationships. The subject of her paintings are everyday people, but every person has something unique to them.""I want to show the beautiful uniqueness of every person who roams the earth  "" with the idea that we are all connected to each other.""  Influenced by a modern interpretation of classical and impressionist styles, Tania paints primarily male portraiture. Her use of gradients, vibrant colours, and defined textures (all of her paintings are on plywood) helps Tania express a reflective mood that examines human nature. Her works typically include a solitary subject or small groups, and Tania attempts to reference other characters within the piece or illustrate emotions to build a story, allowing her artwork to serve as a gateway through which viewers can engage with her work. <figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3050px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3050px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63623758da06914070941cf1_solitary%20man-tania-rivilis-3050x3050-400dpi.jpg"" loading=""lazy""> <figcaption><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1G2WvH3GuH1aAgJWHeKPahA49obBhgoDgS/5"" target=""_blank""><em>I'll be what I am - a solitary man </a><em>, by Tania Rivilis. </figcaption></figure>""Without creating these relationships, my portraits would just act as an external reference of features. My portraits would be empty shells without a soul. When we see this person's emotions and connect to them through a story, it makes them human and not just a flat painting."" Her pieces express romantic melancholy.""I want people who look at my paintings to feel as though they've lost something, in a good way, and that each moment, like each individual, is unique and precious.""  In turn, web3 gives her paintings even more layers, making it easy to find and collaborate with animators, poets, musicians, and other artists who have embraced the independence of web3 creativity and the ease of smart contract royalty payments. Allowing her to combine different mediums, Tania creates art as NFTs that she never would have been able to create with a brush alone.  Tania's work is sparked by a curiosity that she was born with.""I grew up in a little village, on a farm in Ukraine. It's practically destroyed now¶ but I was very adventurous in nature and a curious child."" This childhood curiosity bears a strong influence over her artwork, and she is most inspired by bringing her subjects to life through the rich colours and imagined backstories that she first experienced growing up in eastern Europe.  Much like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/jan-baumgartner"">Jan Baumgartner</a>, Tania begins her creative process by finding  "" and photographing  "" a person who inspires her. She'll happily ask strangers if she can photograph them; if not, she works from memory.""I paint with a feeling and try not to just copy the photograph. I use the photos as reference points and try to abstract from reality."" Tania exclusively paints on plywood which adds layers of texture and depth to her artwork.""It's a very capricious but beautiful texture. I spend much time preparing it, but it is part of my aesthetic.""  But it hasn't always been. For a long time, Tania wasn't an artist. She first picked up a paint brush eight years ago after meeting her husband at the age of 27. At the time, he said that he""saw a sadness"" in Tania and bought her painting materials.""I had something inside of me to express, but I didn't know how."" Tania reveals that when she first started""my hands would shake while painting my portraits, but now I confidently experiment with crazy colours and wide brush strokes.""   When she first came to NFTs, Tania was shocked that people would pay so much money for digital art. Her Foundation genesis, <a href=""https://foundation.app/tania_rivilis/foundation/26248""> Poet from St. Moritz </a>, met its reserve within an hour, ultimately selling to a pseudonymous collector by the name <a href=""https://twitter.com/shilldianajones"">@shilldianajones</a>.""You can create whatever medium of art you want and someone will enjoy it.""   ""I had something inside of me to express, but I didn't know how.""    Tania Rivilis   Upon entering web3, Tania admits that she was stuck in her traditional views of art: that it had to be something you can touch or hang on a wall. In time spent amidst the open forum of web3, Tania has grown to appreciate that there are no limits to the mediums and collaboration an artist can pursue. Recalling what NFTs have done for artistic individuality and simplified royalty splits, she notes that""you almost never see such impactful collaborations and mixed mediums in the traditional art world, but web3 makes it possible.""  Embracing NFTs has let Tania think outside-of-the-box, experiment with digital art, poetry, animation, and music, and collaborate with other artists to explore what she describes as""unlimited human imagination."" She's collaborated on projects with <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/laurence-fuller"">Laurence Fuller</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/objktcom/status/1537876487516192768"" target=""_blank"">Val Kilmer</a>, whilst her work has been collected by the likes of <a href=""https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici/status/1542379139264434177"">Cozomo de Medici</a>, who bought her piece  Kupka's Dog , winner of the Royal Portrait Society's William Lock Portrait Prize.""It's amazing how even just one year in NFTs can act as a springboard for artists.

Tania aims to continue building her NFT artwork and collaborating with artists,""using multiple mediums and collaborations to build something entirely new and beautiful.""  Looking to the future, Tania hopes for the traditional art world to begin to integrate web3 technologies into their operations, simplifying the processes for copyright enforcement and royalty payments. More broadly, she says that""I'm looking forward to the progression of web3, NFT collections, and technology in reference to the landscape of our in real life' society.""   ""You don't have to suffer.""    Tania Rivilis   Tania's artwork is defined by creating imaginative stories around real people. Her characters act as barriers, breaking through into a new world and connecting with those who stare in awe at her paintings. She seeks to explore the human form as we know it and create something to resonate with your soul.""In this way, I attempt to make sense of history and discover life at the intersection of psychoanalysis and semiotics: the lack of fixed integrity of the human self. In the interconnectedness, I express the necessary search for a reliable support to define, to answer the question,  Who am I?' "" ",2378
" ""Now, the artist has a chance to be heard on their own""  in conversation with Taya Ferdinand",taya ferdinand,Sat Jun 18 2022 20:24:47," ""I would rather create art about losers and give them a spotlight."" Georgie Miller sits down with Taya Ferdinand to explore the message behind the melancholy and the role of roosters in Taya's digital paintings, and how web3 gave her an opportunity that she couldn't turn down.",Mon Jun 20 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,Art,Digital-Art; Paintings-2; Ukraine; Europe,Georgie,"Upon first look, viewers of Taya Ferdinand's work tend to find themselves amidst a frenzy of feelings. The deep hues, whimsical strokes, and soulfully grounding subjects spark nostalgia, intrigue, sadness, and calm in a few quick glances. The Ukrainian-born artist's digital paintings, lying at the intersection of folklore and spirituality, are just that. ""Many pieces show my own emotions at that given time,"" Ferdinand says of her moody portraits. With a unique style blending magical realism and a sharp perspective on colour and light, Taya creates moving snapshots meant to capture the emotions of a single moment in each of her digital paintings.  Growing up alongside farm animals in the Ukrainian countryside and surrounded by rural folklore, Taya developed a deep, almost mystic, kinship with the natural world portrayed in her art. Farm animals are a frequent subject; her<a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/chicken-collective"" >  Chicken Collective </a> explores the lives of chickens and their perspective of the world.  This collection of 30 digital portraits, set to music with glittering animations, illustrates the often forgotten animal of global culture.""Before creating  Chicken Collective , I already had many artworks depicting them, and I was getting messages from people asking,""why chickens?"" They are just farm animals and considered losers', so I thought,""I would rather create art about losers and give them a spotlight. They deserve to be respected, especially after how much they are treated as meat and seen as cowardly birds."" The variation of colour and light across the same subject speaks to Taya's ability to capture a different set of sentiments in each iteration of the series.""I want to transfer the viewer into another universe, to evoke lost memories of childhood and the feeling of magic that we have forgotten as we became adults. Our inner child is still hidden somewhere inside us.""  Before diving fully into NFTs last May, Taya worked as a graphic designer in Berlin.""Before web3, I never thought about being a full-time digital artist. Digital art and artists were used as instruments in achieving goals by other companies, like the game industry, or magazines.""  She quickly found that her illustrative talents and unique artistic voice had a natural home within the cryptoart community. Taya's paintings personify her animal subjects and illustrate their emotional significance, often portraying them in a nurturing light, providing comfort or sharing an emotional scene, producing a powerful statement on the relationship between nature and animals. ""The possibilities of digital art are very wide, so I'm always trying new things which I would probably never do in the world without web3,"" she says. Taya's first foray into web3 came with her collection Tamed. Taking inspiration from animal folklore to ruminate on the""view of domestic animals in a non-consuming way and the spiritual connection they build with humans,"" the series evokes the influence that animals have on our lives, their significance, and their role helping us connect with nature.    Woman and a rooster  is the first of the Tamed collection and Taya's earliest minted artwork. Inspired by voodoo culture, the painting features a seated woman with a patterned head tie, holding a rooster on her lap. The woman is adorned with light face paint and her eyes are closed, reflecting the woman's introspective moment in solitude as she faces away from the viewer. Centred in the painting is the rooster, eye-catching and colourful, indicative, even in these deep moments of introspection, of the significance of the animal to human lives. Often used as a sacrifice in voodoo ceremonies of worship, the connection between the rooster and the woman presents simultaneous emotions of new beginnings and past tribulations.   With a signature style, Taya nonetheless experiments broadly across her medium to find the visual complement of every feeling and whim in her work. Taya's  Dreams  collection, a two-painting series, explores the soul-touching emotion of human connection and spirituality within the female body. A study of the mystery of dreams and the mystical world of the subconscious mind, they are painted with a stark contrast of light and shadows, each illustrating a sleeping woman, surrounded by sweeping colour, half-naked. The two subjects give emotions of vulnerability, of teetering the line between euphoria and terror.  Taya's captivating style and impassioned paintings lends itself to digital creatorship that could not be expressed without NFTs.""Now, the artist has a chance to be heard on their own,"" she says.""This was the main attraction for me: freedom of creating and sharing your art with the whole world, and also the possibility to make a living from it.""  With several new ideas in the works, including incorporating her own compositions into her paintings, Taya is gaining accolades in the diverse cryptoart movement, exhibiting how mediums enabled by web3 technologies can transcend the digital and give voice to the deep-rooted moments and emotions felt by the viewer.""I'm very excited about what the future will bring.""  ç ",1480

Clovis McEvoy speaks with some of the organisers about the essential work they are doing, and how their organisation might serve as a blueprint for future campaigns.
",Wed Feb 22 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,Community-society,Fundraising; Turkey; Syria; Charity,Clovis McEvoy,"On February 6th, two devastating earthquakes struck Syria and Turkey, and the Tezos community immediately sprang into action. Within 48 hours, a number of groups and individuals had coalesced to form TezQuakeAid, a grassroots fundraising body that's harnessing the power of artists and collectors to provide direct aid to those affected by the disaster.  Thus far, the project has participation from over 500 artists who have minted some 600 artworks, raising over 91,000  Tezos. It's an innovative approach that has become emblematic of the Tezos community, with various stakeholders coming together to redirect the blockchain's thriving art market to provide immediate aid on a global scale. ""The TezQuakeAid team consists of marketplaces, artists, collectors, and web3 galleries, all working together,"" says Leo Shank, founder of the web3 gallery,<a href=""https://www.xcollabz.com/"" > XCOLLABZ</a>, and one of the early driving forces behind the fundraising effort.""People are contributing their time to help with the process and we've been able to tap into all the necessary skill sets needed to make this efficient and effective."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3840px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3840px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63f602c30c71415e8a9ea079_Medea%20Ganbrood.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Medea, by  <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/ganbrood-on-finding-ultimate-creative-freedom-with-ai"" > Ganbrood </a> . Proceeds from the 35 highest grossing editions were donated to the TezQuakeAid fund. </figcaption></figure> Taking full advantage of web3's capacity for direct and transparent financial transactions, Leo says that the team managed to put structures in place and get funds to on-the-ground NGOs in a timeframe that simply would not have been possible in web2.""I think it took a day and a half, or two days tops, and we were able to mobilise, and commence the donation process,"" Leo says.  That does not mean that there were not significant challenges, perhaps the chief of which was choosing which NGOs TezQuakeAid would donate to. Concrete poet and experimental typographer,<a href=""https://linktr.ee/merchantcoppola"" > Merchant Coppolla</a>, has worked intensively to ensure that the donations go to the NGOs which fit the needs of the Turkish and Syrian people. Having previously helped organise Tezos fundraisers for Pakistan during the devastating flooding of 2022, and for the women's rights protest movement in Iran, Merchant says that choosing the right NGOs is""one of the first milestones you have to reach"" to make an effective impact. ""People from the affected region should have the first say in choosing which organisation they are comfortable with,"" he says.""For the Turkish community, it was very easy, because there was a general consensus to give<a href=""https://ahbap.org/"" > AHBAB</a> the donations. Syria, however, was much trickier; there are sanctions, and it's really hard to have stable connections to the people via the internet. So, we simply don't have as many Syrian community members.""  After pre-vetting a number of organisations that were known to have dedicated earthquake funds, there was an internal discussion with Syrian members of the community before the team settled on the<a href=""https://www.sams-usa.net/who-we-are/"" > Syrian American Medical Society Foundation</a> and<a href=""https://www.savethechildren.net/"" > Save the Children</a> for their first round of donations. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63f6046f54c9d8bbb62d1a42_old%20post%20office%20f%20dilek.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/KT1HBRyTboCW6aFtoofA4AzKP1KqV7DZFEH9/24"" > Old Post Office </a> , by F. Dilek Uyar, the entire proceeds of which will be donated to TezQuakeAid. </figcaption></figure> Part of the team's concern stemmed from having to navigate the international sanctions placed upon Syria's regime, however, matters benefited from the fact that all of TezQuakeAid's finances were open, transparent, and ultimately directed towards trusted NGOs. Award winning photographer and web3 artist,<a href=""https://fdilekyurdakul.eth.co/""> F. Dilek Uyar</a>, says this approach stands in stark contrast to what she's seen from the government in her native Turkey. ""There is no transparency,"" says Dilek regarding the Turkish government's response to the earthquakes.""But all the things in TezQuakeAid have been transparent; the money is going directly to the donation wallet. In my opinion, this is a great chance to educate people and show them how things can be done differently.""   ""We are doing things that can become a framework for the future.""    Leo Shank, founder of XCOLLABZ   With zero operating costs, open financial books, and 100% of donations going directly to NGOs, there are many things that TezQuakeAid is doing differently from its web2 counterparts. Perhaps the most innovative of which is the way that the team has tapped into Tezos' pre-existing ecosystem of collectors and artists to offer a new way for people to help in a moment of crisis.  As Dilek puts it:""I'm not a rich woman, I don't have much money to donate. I've given what I can to some foundations in Turkey but it's not enough  so, if I can donate my art, if my art can be used in a way that helps people, it's a great honour for me.""  The team is hopeful that TezQuakeAid will lay the foundations for a more permanent support system capable of rapidly responding to global issues.""Right now, we've been reacting quickly and adapting as we go because time is of the essence,"" Leo says.""But we are doing things that can become a framework for the future. We have to think as human beings, rather than as citizens of individual countries, because next time it could be us, and we will need this support.""  The response to TezQuakeAid so far has been inspiring, but more help is needed. The news coming out of both Turkey and Syria is stark: more than 13 million people have been affected, 84,000 buildings have been destroyed, and the death toll now tops 41,000 in Turkey and 6000 in Syria.    ""This is a great chance to educate people and show them how things can be done differently.""    F. Dilek Uyar  ""In these natural disasters,"" Merchant says,""first you need immediate medical help, but then you have to shift to sanitation and shelter because one of the biggest threats is diseases that will arise from, for example, a lack of clean water."" Accordingly, TezQuakeAid says that they plan to regularly re-evaluate which NGOs they work with to ensure that the assistance provided matches the evolving needs of the people on the ground.  With two new earthquakes, measuring 6.4 and 5.8, hitting Turkey on Monday this week, the TezQuakeAid team emphasises the need to raise wider awareness of their efforts, to bring more artists, collectors, and volunteers into the campaign, and to continue raising funds as Syria and Turkey begin the slow process of rebuilding.""There are still many problems with tents, with temporary housing,"" Dilek says.""This is not a short-term fight; this is a long-term fight.""

Danish artist Kristian Levin had entered the NFT scene in late 2020 and was looking to meet like-minded artists in the new territory that he found himself in. Kristian, who goes by his pseudonym noCreative, is known for his striking 3D and digital cloth work, set in classical surroundings. He christened the Discord group Home', a place where they could seek advice and constructive feedback, a place where artists could feel at home in a brave new world.  Alongside early members Steph Kunkelan Duquesnoy and Icki, noCreative organised Twitter Spaces for the collective to discuss their art, processes, and thoughts, with the sole purpose of helping one each other learn and grow. The result was a close virtual companionship that proved to be  though unknown at the time  the kick-off meetings for the collective.  Many art review calls' later, general interest in digital art began to grow in 2021. People who previously showed little enthusiasm for art became more and more engaged; digital art won increasing recognition and profits made by traders rotated into the NFT market  from apes to art, as one might put it. The collective's Discord Home started thinking about how they could better collaborate to take advantage of the moment.""Joining forces in a collective seemed the perfect way,"" says Icki, whose work takes cues from both minimalism and conceptual art. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63d903c8f3dacf53e540b621_ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://foundation.app/@Icki/foundation/61870"" > META-PLAGIARISM </a> , from Icki's  Plagiarism  collection. </figcaption></figure> Bloom is a collective of eleven artists distributed across the world, including  in addition to noCreative, Steph Kunkelan, and Icki  artists such as <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/jenni-pasanen"" >Jenni Pasanen</a>, <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/shavonne-wong"" >Shavonne Wong</a>, and <a href=""https://culture3.xyz/posts/onyro"" >Onyro</a>, with expertise ranging across photography, fashion, traditional, 3D, and AI art, as well as digital painting. In addition to that, the group possesses significant knowledge gained from working in technology sectors and commercial environments.""It was all about finding the right mix,"" Icki summarises.   ""You get critiqued by people you respect, which can help you have breakthroughs.""     Icki   Whereas collectives are usually built around a certain artistic trait that every member shares, the common denominator in Bloom is intellectual, rather than thematic.""We are all very straightforward and direct, which is needed to have actual, good conversations about our art and processes,"" says Steph Kunkelan, a Dutch artist who began his career in IT, before transitioning to designing art for games, and later to creating digital post-romanticism art.  This shared intellectual approach is what unites Bloom's members.""We argue, but in an amicable and respectful way. Sometimes the given feedback can be a bit harsh, but we created a safe space and all know that the intentions are pure,"" says Icki. The main goal, as it is commonly understood, is to discuss art in a truthful and respectful environment; all members have a genuine desire to see each other thrive. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2560px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2560px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63724424c22b258a27aac260_organica.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://knownorigin.io/gallery/256800-organica""> Organica </a> , an""abstract organic cellular structure"", by Onyro. </figcaption></figure> Simply put, the philosophy of the collective is to""talk about art a lot, basically,"" Icki grins.""It can be pretty brutal out there and creating digital art can be very recursive. You get critiqued by people you respect, which can help you have breakthroughs."" Sharing your work on Twitter is all well and good, and is an easy place to receive positive, if brief, feedback, but to receive the thoughtful constructive criticism that is really required to progress, artists have to look beyond their public feed, and towards trusted collaborators instead.  This approach works for Bloom because there is a""shared maturity"" in the group. David Lisser, best known for his cultured-meat' artworks, explains that""we all know who we are as artists and have a certain confidence in what we are trying to transmit. Subsequently, critique is better to take. It is really amazing to have such a diversity of tools to help each other grow."" He adds, laughing,""I have actually got a healthy amount of imposter syndrome now. The other artists drive me to do better than before because I see what cool things they are doing.""  Onyro, a 3D digital abstract artist, adds that the collective also gives a sense of accountability:""I want to create things that not only I am proud of, but that can contribute to the whole group."" A common thread is how they feel that they are growing faster than ever. Steph Kunkelan explains that""we challenge each other to help everyone reach their full potential, whilst being patient and helpful when someone is stuck.""  And whilst art in web3 is the direct  and original  focus, Bloom has emerged into much more than a community-help collective.""If you look at it from a broad perspective, we are all discovering the relationship between human and machine, and between computer and art in our own way,"" Steph Kunkelan says.""Who are we as a person, versus the technology we use? What is the entirety of web3 about, and how can we use it to our advantage?,"" he muses. Those are the questions that are raised during the group calls of the collective.   ""The impact for me has been significant,"" Icki says.""I was very conceptually driven and my art lacked identity. Through the discussions I had with the Bloom members, I realised this and made a shift."" The British artist explains that his work is now inspired by a subversive treatment of reductionist and conceptual themes, in response to the world around him.""The difference between web3 and the traditional art world,"" he continues,""is that we have to do everything ourselves. The only art critique in web3 seemed to be the algorithm, so we wanted to take matters into our own hands.""  Finnish artist Jenni Pasanen adds that""even before I joined Bloom, members in the collective had been supporting and helping me so much. It's a group of alike people who create with passion.""  Members not only review each other's art, but also seek out the definition of art in the context of web3.""The conversations we have are invaluable,"" Steph Kunkelan explains.""We are figuring out how to be an artist in relation to being a person, in a world that is inevitably changing at incredible speed.""

Clovis McEvoy speaks to Water & Music's Jonathan Larr about the builder, off-chain benefits, and drawing up a new legal framework for the web3 era completely from scratch.",Sat Jul 23 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,Blockchain,Music; Contracts; Water-Music; Applications,Clovis McEvoy," Over the last few years Water & Music has emerged as the go-to resource for research and data on the emerging web3 music industry. Founded by Cherie Hu in 2016 as an experimental sandbox for music innovation, the organisation joined the third Seed Club <a href=""https://club.mirror.xyz/Q5QwN3Uol03pOK8MhAVsfwc0ektDlrkrl6sVSoC2UwA"">cohort</a> and became a DAO in late 2021.  Today, they boast newsletter readership in the tens of thousands and their 1,500-strong research community spans everyone from emerging artists to start-up founders and C-suite music executives. Their pioneering research is helping musicians understand trends, build strategies, and innovate in the sector. Nowhere is this truer than in their contribution to our understanding of NFT music contracts.  Jonathan Larr is a practising music lawyer who teaches papers in music business at UCLA, and USC in California, and is one of the DAO's leading researchers and drivers behind their work on NFT copyright law. We sat down to discuss the importance of the Music NFT <a href=""https://contractbuilder.waterandmusic.com/"">Contact Builder</a>, the legal landscape that made it a necessity, and the team's future development plans.  Towards the end of 2021, Jonathan and fellow researchers at Water &amp; Music set out to get some perspective on the <a href=""https://www.waterandmusic.com/defining-music-nft-ownership-from-the-digital-to-the-analog-world"">legal frameworks</a> surrounding music NFTs.""We took every publicly available music NFT contract we could find and went through them,"" he says. What they found was far from reassuring: there was little consistent language and few common standards from one contract to the next, and many were making simple but consequential errors.""We realised that a lot of them were bad, and they were bad in very fundamental ways.""  Foundational concepts, like the legal distinction between a song's sound recording copyright, and its composition copyright  "" i.e., its music and lyrics  "" were being blurred or entirely confused. Many of the contracts they reviewed were drawn up by independent artists""doing the best they could"" without legal advice or specific knowledge of copyright law. Seeing the lack of standardised frameworks, and the pitfalls this could create down the line, Jonathan proposed a solution.""I had the idea of making a template contract that artists could use. Something that would, at the very least, be legally correct.""  After taking his proposal to the Water &amp; Music team, the project eventually grew into an interactive <a href=""https://www.waterandmusic.com/structuring-law-web3-music-modular-nft-contract-framework/"">tool</a> that populates a legal contract based on an artist's responses. There are pop-up messages that alert you to common areas of confusion which can trip up non-lawyers, and the tool also acts as an educational resource, with explainers for each clause and background reading for those looking to improve their understanding of copyright law.  Released in March, Jonathan says the community response has been""overwhelmingly positive overall, which is great. People have really liked it, a lot of artists have used it, and found it really helpful."" However, he says the team also encountered some pushback to their initial report from web3 musicians who felt there was too much pressure to apply web2 legal concepts to this new and rapidly evolving market.   ""If you buy a piece of the sound recording copyright and the contract says you receive royalties, and then you don't, that's a lawsuit.""    Jonathan Larr  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" style=""max-width:50%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright"" data-rt-max-width=""50%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62e3d8917933ad4823b8ea61_WM%20Contract%20Builder%203.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > The builder includes educational terms to help musicians understand music copyright, dispersing knowledge that all creators should be ready to leverage if the need comes. </figcaption></figure>  ""Some people have that kind of move fast and break things' tech philosophy, which basically means they're not going to hire lawyers or won't care what lawyers say and will just go ahead with it and see what happens."" Of course, that anarchic spirit can lead to significant innovation in the right circumstances, but music NFT contracts with vague, conflicting, or even misleading language can be a minefield if things turn sour. ""We're trained to think in terms of lawsuits,"" Jonathan says of his own perspective.""If you buy a piece of the sound recording copyright and the contract says you receive royalties, and then you don't, that's a lawsuit.""  Whether the result of honest error or of intentional boundary pushing, contracts that leave one party holding the short straw have the potential to damage the delicate and reciprocal relationship web3 artists have with fans and supporters. That's why Water &amp; Music's contract builder, and its ongoing development, is such a significant resource for independent musicians.  Following feedback from their community, the <a href=""https://www.waterandmusic.com/music-nft-contract-template-v2-off-chain-benefits/"">latest version</a> has added language to support a rapidly growing area of music NFT's: off-chain, real world benefits. Physical merchandise and access to backstage or VIP experiences are nothing new, but once Jonathan and his colleague Brett Kaminsky, an attorney and fellow W&amp;M member, began digging into how these contracts were adapted for NFTs, they found that many were startlingly vague. ""We thought there would be plenty of language out there describing, for example, what happens if you go to a venue and you buy an NFT for a meeting (or event), and it's not valid  "" what do you do? Who do you contact? And there really wasn't any."" Without any clear existing contract law to pull from, the two lawyers were forced to draft the legal language that was eventually used in the contract builder to cover real-world benefits""more or less from scratch"". <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3354px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3354px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62e3d7a7a965ba56c2df8bbe_WM%20Contract%20Builder%202.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > A screenshot from the Water &amp; Music NFT Contract Builder. The builder currently only generates contracts for US musicians that grant holders non-commercial licenses, but plans to expand internationally to countries like the UK, India, and Japan, as well as for further use cases, like commercial licenses. </figcaption></figure> Currently, the contract builder only covers US law, but the team are hopeful that it can be expanded to include a number of different countries in the future. However, Jonathan says this would be dependent on getting input from people with the relevant expertise.""We're cautious. UK law isn't that different, but we'd want to get a UK lawyer or a European lawyer who can vet things. We've had a couple of Indian lawyers who are interested, we've had some Japanese lawyers who are interested. So, we'd love to adapt it to those countries, those languages. That might be a part of version three.""   ""It's going to be regulated in some fashion.""    Jonathan Larr   Beyond adapting the contract builder to other legal systems, there are many other areas of contract law that artists are clamouring to see included in the template, such as event ticketing and royalty splits. However, Jonathan says right now these areas are either too complex to be easily covered by the template or, as in the case of royalty splits, they're awaiting clarity from regulators like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding what regulatory burdens will be placed on NFTs going forward.""They're definitely going to come out and say something. They might come out and say that royalty investments are not a security, they might say it is, but it's going to be regulated in some fashion.""  That uncertainty just underscores how fast the music NFT ecosystem has evolved and how much catching up the legal establishment has yet to do. Asked what areas of the law still seem ill-defined or too fast moving to get a handle on, Jonathan replies:""It'd be easier to say which ones aren't! The law is always behind where things are at, but in this case, it's even more so because of the pace of advancement. But that's what I've found really interesting about this project: trying to put a legal structure in place, and hopefully designing some standards in an area where there isn't any of that yet.""

Enter the Grotto: there's more to thr33som3s than you think,thr33som3s,Wed Oct 19 2022 08:59:06,"Growing up isOla Kalejayeted from civilisation, thr33som3s immersed himself in books as a child, opening a gateway to another world. It was a gateway that led him to develop an NFT baseball Lea Rose Emerygue on Tezos and a narrative moulded by his Grotto community. He tells Steph Kunkel Kunkel how all it took was following his imagination.",Wed Oct 19 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,art,Paintings-2; Generative; Tezos; Usa; North-America,Steph Kunkel," As a child, thr33som3s animated real baseball mascots to inspire his own imaginary baseball league. The San Francisco Giants as actual giants, the Detroit Tigers as actual tigers, and so forth. Now with an collection comprising with 8 franchises, 16 more teams in the works, and a thriving community that thr33som3s, known as 3s, christened the Grotto', the painted cards have evolved into a fully-fledged NFT baseball league and a commentary on American society and nostalgia.  Born and raised in an isolated part of the US, about which he shares little, 3s turned to culture and narrative. In many ways, his experience in web3 has been exactly the same. Upon entering the space, thr33som3s spent months learning its cadence, navigating the hierarchy of decentralised culture, and imagining starting his own platform. He wanted to integrate play and community, where collectors could be a part of the progression of a project, helping build and decide its future. In NFTs, thr33som3s saw an opportunity to bring his artistic mission to life leveraging blockchain and the communities that can be built around them. ""What's more American than baseball?"" thr33som3s asked himself.""What captures American nostalgia and the cinematic trope of the American dream more than a boy running to the store to collect baseball cards?"" Superficially, his cards look like just that, perhaps with hints of satire, but this is only a faißade for the allegorical narration of modern American society running underneath; a nostalgia for the American Dream.  Thr33som3s' <a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/787775"">baseball league</a> all happens in the Grotto, which hosts a fictional realm with its own governance, style, and way of life. Composed of various levels, players and collectors can unlock access as they navigate through thr33som3s' world. He has released 8 sets of cards, with each set representing a team, and has plans for 16 more, all provocative or otherwise carefully considered themes and names, like the Elephant Men team, a Subs team that 3s has depicted as submissives, or an NFT team, featuring the likes of Beeple and ThankYouX.  However, thr33som3s NFT baseball cards are more than just clever JPEGs. Every series resembles a new team, the most recent being the eighth, Elephant Men, at series 9 (series 1 was just a preamble). Meanwhile, each series comprises cards boasting different mechanics and levels of utility, split between base cards, chase cards (which are earnt for collecting base cards), and inserts, which bring special colour-coded perks for the ecosystem, like bidding (orange), participating in team events (yellow), or painting (white and black). Thr33som3s collectors don't play baseball games in the traditional sense, but the goal in each season is for each team to accrue as many of the season's cards as they can. The number of drop cards slightly changes from season to season, as do the the perks in each series, keeping collectors on their toes. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/634fc6e241bd1b544703ce5f_1e097613df6fececc88a2fc9b95fc238.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xdee1996336fcabb458c2b92fce19cf84eb587e64/90"">Thr33zi3s #0090</a>  "" the alter ego of NFT artist: 3s. </figcaption></figure> From events and podcasts to season drops and minigames, collectors are able to explore, play, and participate in this world both inside and outside web3. The 8 baseball teams are now actual franchises, in a basic sense, run by collectors who use a typical sports management model. The beginning of each season begins with a drop and a regular game day, where teams face off in a team event until a winner earns a reward in thr33p3nnies, the league's native token. You can join the roster of active players by paying $250 in thr33p3nnies to receive 10 rookie cards. With these, new players can enter a Wheel of Names spinner and win a selection of cards to get started. When they're equipped, they can either attempt to sign to a team or play as a free-agent.  Accordingly, it is fitting that thr33som3s has intertwined his own web3 identity with the Tezos collection. Thr33som3s is an autobiographical inspiration, the protagonist of his NFTs, and our guide.""I like to think of th33som3s as the best parts of me,"" he smiles. Although thr33som3s is a fictionalised character, the persona is based on thr33som3s true self, as well as being part of the larger narrative of the project. ""I don't like to waste words,"" thr33som3s says, adding,""there are no throw away' pieces in the collection."" Each player and each team is designed with a character type, arc, and a story that is presented now, though to be explored in the years to come. Thr33som3s' favourite team is the Elephant Men, inspired by the David Lynch film,  The Elephant Man .""Very stark, but very sad,"" is how 3s describes them: the team is seen as freaks, outcast by society, but on the field, they are just ballplayers.  In thr33som3s' league, Jim Pendleton is painted as Elephant Man, introduced in a card dated 1953 with a burlap sack covering his face. But as the series progresses all the way up to 1989, we see the team's acceptance over the decades. In 1953, the team had to wear sacks, but by 1989 they are accepted by society and can show their faces.  From current news, to his favourite books, to the music he listens to while painting his pieces, thr33som3s draws inspiration from a variety of places, but it all boils down to American culture and cinematic inspiration writ large.""Anything that's important to me manages to find its way into the collection,"" he explains. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2894px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2894px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/634fcc96b676b73c93287461_artifact.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Jim Pendleton, 1953 Elephant Men - Series 9 -  <a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/757843""> #013 </a></figcaption></figure> It's easy to dismiss thr33som3s' work as simply painting over vintage baseball cards. Technically, that's not wrong. Thr33som3s' NFTs are digital captures of his original paintings, gouache on vintage baseball cards, predominantly from the '60s and '70s. But to say he only reworks old baseball cards misses the point. Each element of collection is intentionally curated to establish a story, a narrative from the thr33som3s persona, resonating with every team and each player. As an art project with utility and community, the baseball card element is merely a justification for the league format, which in itself is just a structure to hang ideas from, inspiring his other drops. The league and the cards that bring it life are merely the home base for an expansive realm of storytelling.  One of thr33som3s' most creative NFT projects is his thr33zi3s collection. Inspired by the baseball league, thr33zi3s integrates multiple onchain elements to create generative, hand-painted collectibles. Each thr33zi3s is individually hand painted, as 3s physically paints each trait, as dictated by the algorithm, and physically repaints them as traits are burned away for utility.   ""I like to think of th33som3s as the best parts of me.""  thr33som3s   Thr33som3s knows all of his collectors and speaks to his community every day through the Grotto discord, his podcast, and private messaging. Packed full of interactive elements, franchises, virtual and in-person events, and drop mechanics allow collectors various opportunities to integrate themselves into the thr33som3s world. These various channels allow him to drive the ongoing economy, value, and narrative of the collection.""Anyone who buys my pieces should really love it,"" he says, stressing the importance of the narrative and the story, whilst noting that""the pieces are designed with future utility in mind, to retain their value (if not grow), and the pieces should either give you either access to something new or will evolve over time.""  Thr33som3s has created an entire community that extends beyond the world of web3, with highly invested collectors who have incorporated the Grotto into their everyday lives. And with just a third of the teams released for the thr33som3s league so far, this culturally astute project is far from over. The beauty of these NFT baseball players is that they live just below the surface of reality, allowing collectors to step into this universe, embrace their characters, and live inside this fantasy.

NFTs allow event hosts to turn their tickets into longer-term activations for attendees, whilst solving problems with counterfeiting and ticket touts that plague the ticketing sector. By <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/nft-ticketing"">issuing tickets as NFTs</a> through a smart contract, event hosts can embed constraints on how tickets are used even after they sell, such as capping resale prices, whilst UEFA used NFT tickets for the international Euro 2020 football tournament, which activated only when ticket holders got close to the relevant stadium. Additionally, since NFT tickets are issued on the blockchain where ownership can be easily verified, it is extremely difficult to counterfeit. ""Over the past several months, we've seen artist after artist like Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift face heat because of issues fans struggle with when trying to purchase tickets,"" said YellowHeart CEO Josh Katz, whose company provides NFT ticketing solutions.""At YellowHeart, we offer a smart ticketing model, which allows the ticket issuer to dictate if a ticket can be resold and cap any resales at a specific percentage. Artists, teams, and venues also get a cut of secondary sales, which currently is completely dominated by scalpers. As we reimagine how tickets are sold and distributed, the possibilities are endless."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1339px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1339px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62b4f1fe35b312ed29686676_katz.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption >Josh Katz, founder of YellowHeart.""As we reimagine how tickets are sold and distributed, the possibilities are endless.""</figcaption></figure> An even bigger impact lies beyond the ticket itself, connecting directly with fans through the ticket, which becomes a token to access more than just one event. By providing exclusive access to token-gated content, special perks, and digital communities, NFT ticketing has already enabled top artists like Maroon 5, Zhu, and Lewis Capaldi to increase fan engagement with their most loyal supporters. One example comes from Kings of Leon, whose NFT ticket initiative included 18 tickets providing fans with front-row concert tickets at every tour the band does, for life.  Industry incumbents like Ticketmaster have begun to take notice, releasing their own NFT ticketing capabilities in partnership with the Flow blockchain. So far, Ticketmaster has minted over 5 million NFTs for event organisers, whilst corporations like MGM Resorts and TAO Group Hospitality have partnered with Yellow Heart to implement their own NFT ticketing programmes.  AI-created culture  Products like DALL-E 2 and ChatGPT are transforming the way we create. Opening up the ability to generate unique ideas with a few lines of text, these AI tools are already pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of digital creativity while reducing workflow speeds to a fraction of what they once were.  Adobe has developed a suite of AI tools for content creation, including Adobe Sensei, which uses machine learning to automatically suggest edits and enhancements to images and videos, whilst AI is becoming a key part of the game development workflow on engines like Unreal and Unity, as well as <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/webaverse"">in the metaverse</a>, for character generation, decision-making, and animation. Already, we've seen a slew of businesses built on the back of open-access AI tools from avatar creators to app builders to pitch deck generators.   According to AI artist, <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/artificial-bob"">Artificial Bob</a>, artists should either consider AI as a new tool in their workflow or ignore it entirely.""If traditional artists are willing to give it a shot, it can open a lot of doors for them,"" he said.""But standing in the way of a runaway train is completely pointless."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:512px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""512px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63a352dc136bdd3146fe9650_output.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >  ""A painting about the future of culture and AI-generated content,"" generated by  <a href=""https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text2img""> DeepAI </a> . </figcaption></figure> As these tools become more prevalent, it is likely that a significant portion of the media we consume will be influenced by AI. Democratising access to creative expression for both creators and non-creators is important, but we must remain cognizant of the potential for AI-generated content to homogenise and add bias to our cultural landscape, leading to a loss of diverse perspectives and ideas. The opportunities are plentiful, but how we choose to approach them will make all the difference.  Carbon credits  As the carbon credits market experiences dramatic growth during a period in which the climate crisis attracts growing responses, blockchain is well-positioned to improve its transparency, security, and efficiency. Speaking to Culture3, Emma Sokoloff, partner at Shine Capital, explains that""blockchain technology can create a secure and transparent platform for verifying, buying, selling, and tracking credits, bootstrapping the market's liquidity and integrity.""  In providing greater transparency and traceability throughout the carbon credit value chain, blockchain makes it easy for anyone to verify exactly who is involved in the transaction and whether the credits have been certified by a globally recognised standard, whilst counterfeits can be traced to their source onchain.  This presents opportunities to any supply chain. As Deloitte <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/operations/articles/blockchain-supply-chain-innovation.html"">reports</a>,""organisations can digitise physical assets and create a decentralised immutable record of all transactions, making it possible to track assets from production to delivery or use by end user."" In carbon credit markets, this brings transparency to carbon credit markets, helping ensure that those purchasing carbon offsets can navigate the market confidently and efficiently.  Those benefits exist even in permissioned markets that are valued by larger enterprise clients that make up most of the demand in carbon credits. But in addition, blockchain enables new forms of permissionless markets, in which anyone can purchase credits, and where selling them is more open. Platforms like KlimaDAO and ClimateCoin make carbon credit marketplaces more accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises, and individuals, by tokenising carbons assets onchain where they can be bought by anyone with an internet connection. ""We're not creating another new corporate standard, but working with the existing standards,"" explains Samuel Lee, Head of Strategy at ClimateCoin.""Today, businesses are relying on acquaintances to get their credits sold, but with blockchain there's an instant liquidation opportunity."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63a319ea02e4a06e8a610a86_02%20(2).png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> </figure><h1 >Start Planning: the web3 applications coming soon</h1> Community-led brands  For the first time, brand value is and awareness is not generated solely by employees of the brand, but rather by a broader community of supporters. Enabled by web3, which records distributed ownership of large IP sets on the blockchain, we are witnessing the emergence of a new generation of brands.  Creative strategist Ben Mayor White, the architect behind adidas' $23m web3 activation in 2021, predicts that community-led brands will eventually come to eclipse many web2 giants. He <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/ben-mayor-white"">explains</a> that early movers like Yuga Labs and Gary Vaynerchuk have written a compelling story and narrative for community members to latch on to, but understand how to engage and give distribute control to their community to exploit the advantages that a decentralised brand brings, creating the conditions in which thousands of professionals are motivated to promote IP in which they share ownership.  This is perfectly illustrated by members of Yuga Labs' Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), who have leveraged their commercial IP rights to launch merchandise lines, water companies, and restaurants. Similarly, Vaynerchuk's VeeFriends rolled out its children's toys to Macy's and Toys R Us in the United States. The more the brand grows, the more  everyone  in the community benefits.   ""We will see web3-native IP all around us.""    Swickie   Safa, the pseudonymous founder behind Tally Labs, a web3 media company built around Yuga Labs IP, illustrates the distinction speaking to <a href=""https://nftnow.com/sponsored/media3-how-nfts-and-web3-are-reshaping-storytelling/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDisney%2C%20the%20most%20famous%20Web2,control%20over%20to%20their%20community."">NFT Now</a>.""Disney, the most famous web2 media business, is built on protecting their IP at all costs,"" they explain.""When the Bored Apes came around and offered commercial rights to holders, an entirely new mindset emerged.""  Speaking to Culture3, <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/swickie"">Swickie</a> and <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/lord-truffington"">Lord Truffington</a> reiterate the same theme, observing how the distribution of commercial rights to community members like them has created new opportunities for branding.""We're entering a renaissance era where we will see web3-native IP all around us,"" Swickie says. The marketing executive has leveraged her BAYC IP to launch her own digital community and clothing brand. ""I believe that a web3-based project, one that is still potentially unknown, will be the genesis of tomorrow's legacy brands.""  Consumer products onchain  Bringing physical assets onto the blockchain opens up a range of adjacent opportunities both within and beyond the consumer-brand relationship. Using near-field technology, companies can directly link an NFT to a physical asset, providing customers with verifiable proof of authenticity and ownership mechanisms.

He spent twenty years working in the sync licensing industry, the $3bn sector where producers buy music rights for films, games, and other media.""The data is terrible  "" there's no central database; it takes nine months to receive your money; and it can take two or three years to get paid from foreign sources,"" he <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/dequency"">explains</a>.""It's just a nightmare.""  Smart contract technology lets licensees remove friction in the process to manage rights, and eliminates costly middlemen in the process by automatically enforcing the terms of an agreement whilst ensuring that royalties are paid out in a transparent and timely manner.  Platforms like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/arpeggi"">Arpeggi</a> illustrate the commercial consequences of these technologies. Arpeggi is seeking to disrupt the traditional music sampling industry, which governs how artists can re-use clips, beats, or melodies from pre-existing songs in their own work. In the 1980s, music sampling gave birth to hip-hop and reshaped music, but the significant level of administrative work required to enforce rights and royalties led to the sampling industry becoming dominated by major record labels.  By underpinning a trusted and automated database that is not owned by one party, blockchain technology can fundamentally shift how music sampling industry: licence requests and royalty payments can be managed without friction. Arpeggi is working to enable that shift.""We are incredibly bullish about the future of NFTs for music licensing and attribution over the next five years,"" says Wilton Gorske, Head of Marketing at the a16z-backed company. ""Producers can listen to an artist, buy the sample pack token that corresponds to the license they need (personal, commercial, public), publish their derivative work, and sign it with their corresponding wallet to prove they had clearance rights  all without private intermediaries.""   ""We are incredibly bullish about the future of NFTs for music licensing and attribution.""    Wilton Gorske, Arpeggi   Their long-term plan is to create an ecosystem in which anyone can create a track, pay to licence someone else's music, and have those royalty payments flow seamlessly, potentially revolutionising how musicians govern, and earn from, the rights to their music.  Meanwhile, through secondary royalty structures, Web3 can unlock new business models for artists and their fans alike. We've already begun to see top artists like 3LAU and The Chainsmokers release NFTs of songs and albums directly to their fans, including rewarding their NFT holders with a percentage of the work's royalties in perpetuity. Not only does this give fans digital ownership and a sense of belonging with an artists' community, but it lets musicians bypass streaming giants like Spotify and Apple Music and earn more from their creative works.   Over the next five years, we expect NFTs to transform the entertainment licensing landscape as more artists become attuned to the efficiency and financial benefit of smart contracts. Web3 streaming platforms are not intended to replace existing providers, but provide a major complement, offering a new level of fan-creator connection that these legacy platforms cannot match.  Blockchain real estate  Web3 has much to offer the outdated $200 trillion real estate sector, and blockchain has already demonstrated its capacity to bring title deeds onchain as NFTs, with all the efficiency gains that this brings.  In 2019, Mishcon de Reya, the London Magic Circle law firm, collaborated with the UK Government to develop a blockchain prototype to legally transfer a property and update the UK Government's Land Register. It brought the transaction time down from 22 weeks to just <a href=""https://www.mishcon.com/news/hm-land-registry-towards-a-distributed-ledger-of-residential-title-deeds-in-the-uk"" >10 minutes</a>.  Blockchain property transfers have occurred outside the lab too. In 2018, South Burlington, a city in Vermont of 18,000 people, began a <a href=""https://www.govtech.com/biz/vermont-city-real-estate-startup-try-out-blockchain-for-recording-property-transactions.html"" >pilot</a> with Propy, a web3 real estate firm, that could ultimately lead to the city putting their land registry entirely onchain.  The reason governments are exploring bringing property deeds onchain come down to transparency, efficiency, and security. Immutable transaction records onchain let everyone easily verify ownership and historic pricing data, whilst smart contracts can automate much of the transaction process and accelerate the rest. Combined, these features make transactions more secure, eliminating the possibility of scammers inserting themselves into foreclosure, loan, and purchase processes.  The main obstacle for real estate to move onchain is legal recognition for crypto assets and the appropriate rules for blockchain in the real estate sector. Today, no jurisdiction accommodates NFTs as title deeds, but jurisdictions like the UK are actively pursuing the <a href=""https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/digital-assets/"" >legal recognition of digital assets</a>. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63a302a509cec83ef4fed281_04%20(1).png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> </figure><h1 >Start Listening: scenarios to be aware of</h1> Blockchain voting  Blockchain voting uses digital identities and decentralised ledger technology to create a secure, transparent, and digital voting system. The vision is that it can let democracies move beyond just an election every few years and towards a democracy in which citizens can vote much more often.  However, to get to the stage where citizens have confidence voting digitally, frequently, and from a device as frictionless as their phone, much more innovation needs to come first to definitely resolve issues around security, privacy, and accuracy, across hardware and software. Part of this will come via zero-knowledge proofs, but voters will need years to become comfortable with the technology too.  In principle, however, blockchain voting can solve the problems associated with digital voting. Since each vote is tied to a single identity and recorded on an immutable ledger, governments can accurately verify voting counts and eliminate the possibility of fraud. ""If a [voting] process is run on a blockchain, the process is guaranteed to run according to some pre-agreed code and provide the correct output,"" <a href=""https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/25/voting2.html"" >writes Vitalik Buterin</a> in a 2021 essay.""No one can prevent the execution, no one can tamper with the execution, and no one can block any users' inputs from being processed.""  In solving these problems, blockchain voting can offer a fundamentally new feature set to democracies: enabling a more direct form of democracy at nation-state level scale. Currently, formal democratic inputs are generally restricted to votes every few years.   ""No one can prevent the execution.""    Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum   It was of this representative democratic system, pioneered most successfully in the United Kingdom, that the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote""The English people believes itself to be free; it is gravely mistaken; it is free only during the election of Members of Parliament; as soon as the Members are elected, the people is enslaved.""  If voters had the tools to vote on key topics even outside an election period, like confidence votes or impeachment proceedings, democracy would inevitably become more representative. But by enabling a secure, trusted, and efficient voting system that is easy to use more than once every few years, blockchain could be even more transformative for how democracy works.  Decentralised science  Decentralised science, also known as DeSci, uses web3 technologies like blockchain and decentralised autonomous organisations to democratise and improve traditional scientific processes by connecting scientists to resources, publishers, and funders directly, instead of via established institutions.  Today, this is where science happens, typically in universities or corporate labs. But the bureaucracies in these institutions can slow down the process and embed bias. To date, the costs of these institutions have always been heavily outweighed by the benefit: providing the credibility that the scientific ecosystem relies on.  DeSci improves upon traditional science in two ways. First, by leveraging innovative and decentralised decision-making techniques to allocate funding, distribute resources, and prioritise publications, web3 could help shift the direction of scientific progress in a better direction. Were decisions about lab space and grants opened to a wider range of decision-makers and recipients, with or without more democratic funding techniques like quadratic funding, scientific progress would become the product of a more diverse group of people. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1133px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1133px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63a356d5dd26aa75e10a374b_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(1).png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >Decentralised science enables scientists to raise funding, run experiments, share data, distribute insights, and more, writes the <a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/desci/#:~:text=enables%20scientists%20to%20raise%20funding%2C%20run%20experiments%2C%20share%20data%2C%20distribute%20insights%2C%20and%20more"">Ethereum Foundation</a>. </figcaption></figure> The reason that such a decentralised scientific ecosystem has not arisen to date is that without the credibility badges provided by centralised institutions, like Oxford or Harvard, it is hard to allocate resources and funding efficiently. By underpinning an immutable database, blockchain presents the means of sustaining reputational systems that do not rely on centralised parties.  Decentralised science already has a vibrant <a href=""https://www.cryptoaltruism.org/blog/ten-more-desci-projects"" >core community</a> which demonstrates how this ecosystem is evolving. <a href=""https://thesciencedao.io/"" >The Science DAO</a> is a community funding advances in focus areas from genetics to radiation, whilst <a href=""https://www.vitadao.com/"" >VitaDAO</a> is dedicated to advancing anti-aging research. But to emerge from the forums of hobbying scientists and become the infrastructure upon which science is constructed for the rest of the 21st century, DeSci needs to create more established credibility systems and form bridges with existing institutions where existing resources, funding, and publishers  "" not to mention scientists  "" are currently working.  Zero-knowledge proofs  Zero-knowledge proofs, or ZKPs, allow one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that they possess certain information, without actually revealing that information. In other words, ZKPs allows you to prove that you know something without actually telling anyone what that something is.  A general-purpose technology, ZKPs are poised to become a fundamental part of the internet's underlying infrastructure by the end of the decade, as more sensitive information is digitised and shared online.  For example, in the healthcare industry, ZKPs could be used to allow patients to prove that they have the medical information that is being requested of them, without actually revealing the details of their medical history to anyone else.  In finance, ZKPs could allow financial institutions to better manage risks, by responding to the net exposure of other firms, without actually revealing their trades to each other, potentially reducing the risks presented by misunderstood securities that created the 2008 financial crisis.  Meanwhile, voting systems can use ZKPs to allow voters to prove that they are eligible to vote, without actually revealing their identity. This could help to improve the security and integrity of online voting systems and to prevent fraud or other abuses.  As we continue to spend more time online, ZKPs have the potential to improve the security and privacy of our online systems and protect sensitive information from unauthorised disclosure.   Web3 represents an end-to-end suite of transformative technologies across culture, commerce and society. We have a strong belief that the ten applications above will make significant progress in the 2020s, and that the businesses and individuals who succeed in this decade will, in part, be those who have paid most attention to them.

Reddit creators and independent artists designed a wide array of Snoo variations, and the social media site airdropped NFTs to its most engaged users in August, applying a classic web3 community-first' strategy to half a billion active users.  To claim the NFTs, Redditors had to create a Polygon-based NFT wallet called Reddit Vault  "" all on-site, a simple process that you could do in an instant. None of the classic crypto onboarding was necessary. Two months in, they have been an absolute success.  Reddit users created more than 3 million NFT wallets, according to Reddit's chief product officer Pali Bhat. Polygon recorded a commensurate <a href=""https://twitter.com/blockworksres/status/1584631733672022016"" >explosion in the number</a> of NFT users.

Reddit is also <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/arbitrum"" >experimenting with Arbitrum</a>, to bring its Community Points rewards programme onchain.

The network was recently connected to the Ethereum mainnet, allowing the tokens to be traded across the web3 ecosystem and their holders to be rewarded outside Reddit as well as within it.  Horse before the cart  There is much talk of NFTs going mainstream in the future. But that will not happen by itself, without design decisions conducive to mass adoption.  Reddit's experience points to how mainstream adoption will look, said pseudonymous NFT collector and trader <a href=""https://twitter.com/Loopifyyy"" >Loopify</a>.""It's about user experience, not the underlying technology,"" they tell Culture3.""The marketing starts as simple as changing the terminology [and] smooth onboarding¶ and before [users] know it, they've created a wallet and purchased an NFT.""  The main utility of Reddit's NFTs arrived well before they could be traded. Reddit avatars were already common on the site before they became ownable: the proof-of-concept was ready, and users were comfortable engaging with Snoo.  All people had to do was to claim their airdrop, which resembled an item that they were already familiar with.""Reddit did a key thing for onboarding users  "" they put the NFT content, or their avatars, on the front end for users and kept the technology on the backend.

Over the past eight months, Violetta has been at the forefront of a new kind of career; one built on independence, the grassroots, and innovative utility. In the process, her music NFTs have become one of the space's hottest products, skyrocketing to compete with some of the biggest names in the business.  And she is just getting started:""You can bet that I'll still be here, writing songs, in 40 years  this is a step along the roadmap of a lifelong career.""  When Violetta says lifelong, she means it. Her roots in performance go all the way back to early childhood in Italy, to a home filled with music.""We would jam,"" she laughs,""even when I was like three or four years old, we would just have fun and play."" Quickly recognising her vocal talents, Violetta's parents encouraged her to continue building her skills and, by the age of fifteen, she was regularly performing around her hometown of Regio Emilia.""Town fairs, small festivals, and bars,"" she recalls,""in the summers, I would have maybe a gig a week.""  Her first step into the music industry proper came with an audition on the Italian version of X-Factor at the age 18. Though she originally went in with low expectations to""maybe make it past the audition"", Violetta ultimately reached the finals, taking third place, before parlaying that success into a record deal with Sony Music. What followed was a traditional career path consisting of albums, singles, merchandise, and a whole lot of touring  but all that changed in 2020. As the global pandemic slowed live music to a standstill, Violetta found a pillar of her creative life suddenly denied to her. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2048px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2048px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/630e34c03350edef31b8db1f_zironi1.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >  ""In the summers, I would have maybe a gig a week.""

I was miming my songs, looking pouty at the camera, thinking Is this it? Are you serious? After all these years playing music, is this all I am to everybody? I just couldn't accept that.""  Like many musicians, Violetta's career was hit especially hard by Covid-19, as the frailty of the streaming economy became impossible to ignore. With touring gone and royalty payments not even close to covering her bills, she became increasingly frustrated with the limitations of web2 music. By mid-2021 things were nearing breaking point:""I was so tired of it,"" she recalls.""I was approaching labels, and nobody would acknowledge me. I didn't know where to find my people; I felt like my music would never be good for the radio and there was no way I'd get through to anyone on Spotify. I really felt cut out from traditional media.""  After the highs and lows of over a decade in the music business, for the first time Violetta began to seriously consider calling it a day.""I gave myself one more year,"" she recalls.""I said to myself, if this doesn't work out in a year, then I'm quitting.'"" Looking back now, it's incredible how close she came to changing career paths; yet with six months of that self-issued ultimatum gone, Violetta discovered web3 and a new chapter in her career began. ""The first thing that attracted me was the idea of music being revalued,"" she says of her initial encounter with music NFTs.""The idea of music being considered as a fine art that could be invested in, and not as a commodity to be played in the background."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center"" data-rt-max-width=""""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/630e35375858862f8536e810_61f920882c3842a120081459_NFT1_cropped-p-800.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption >  ""I felt my music would never be good for the radio and there was no way I'd get to anyone on Spotify."" </figcaption></figure> Alongside that fresh economic model, what also got her attention was web3's lack of boundaries, barriers, and intermediaries.""It was insane. I could literally just go to people and play them my songs and tell my story. For the first time, I thought maybe I can find my audience, my people, a group with a passion for art.' So, I was gonna try it, I was going to give it 100%.""   ""I really felt cut out from traditional media.""    Violetta Zironi   Enamoured by the possibilities, she began planning her first music NFT  a process that brought its own challenges. After years of working in the web2 industry, Violetta says her song writing process had become so overburdened with the restrictive marketing concerns of record labels that, at first, she wasn't sure how to approach her newfound creative freedom. ""I was always told you need a song like this for radio, a song like that for live shows, a certain kind of song for TikTok, a certain kind of song for Spotify'. I'd be in the studio, trying to write with all those things in my head. So now here I was thinking  okay, what's the NFT song? What's the rule for this?""  For advice, she reached out to Nifty Sax, one of the pioneering NFT music makers and founder of web3 accelerator Nifty Music.""He told me, There's no rule whatsoever, just do whatever makes you feel comfortable, genuine, and authentic.' It was the first time I felt able to put out the songs as I wanted. I had no manager, no label, no one telling me how I should do it. It was amazing.""  The result was Handmade Songs, three gorgeously stripped-back acoustic ballads and a 1/1 video of Violetta performing in her living room.""I decided that I would just let people in and make it really intimate and very personal,"" she says. Released at the beginning of February with the support of Nifty Sax, the collection was an unreserved success, quickly selling out, and catapulting Violetta to the second spot on the Top of The Blocks NFT music chart.  Validated by that initial success and buoyed by her growing web3 community, she quickly began working on a follow-up collection. Moonshot  a five-song collection that saw her collaborate with her father Giuseppe Zironi, a 30-year veteran animator at Disney, on a series of unique artworks inspired by Violetta's music.  Asked if she had ever wanted to collaborate with her father on previous album art, Violetta says that, once again, it is the kind of thing that was not even an option in her web2 career. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" style=""max-width:40%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright"" data-rt-max-width=""40%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/630e37023e79332e9d0f03d4_62305bc66f05e29003cd9d40_VIOLETTA-EP-MOONSHOT-3-p-1600.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Violetta's Moonshot collection consisted of  <a href=""https://niftymusic.app/violetta-zironi/moonshot""> 2,500 unique, hand-drawn artworks </a>  by her father Giuseppe Zironi, a veteran Disney illustrator. </figcaption></figure>""I never even thought about it before because I knew there'd be someone telling me that it wasn't cool or hip enough,"" she says.""But, here in web3, it's all about characters and cartoons; almost like trading cards. So, it was perfect.""  Released in April, Moonshot has gone on to consistently top the music NFT charts, and was the fourth most traded music collection on OpenSea for the past month, beating out industry giants like Snoop Dogg.  Part of this phenomenal success is down to the quality of the material: Moonshot shows a songwriter in her element, from jazz inflected ballads to slickly produced RnB tracks, Violetta moves from genre to genre as one might slip in and out of a favourite jacket. However, just as important as the music is the enthusiastic and supportive community she has built, and the extended forms of utility derived from holding her NFTs: lifetime free tickets to her shows, free physical merchandise, like vinyls and signed posters, and in-person visits to see Violetta recording in the studio are just some of the innovative perks available to fans. ""I feel like a lot of web2 artists feel detached from their community,"" she says.""Those old platforms don't really allow you to engage in a meaningful way. I try to involve my holders as much as possible, I keep them updated with strategic decisions, my new songs and the way I want to arrange them.

Amongst various speaking engagements and a twitter spaces' tour, she recently performed in New York at NFT.NYC and has another performance lined up for NFT London in November. She is also busy working on her new album and NFT collection. Asked if it ever gets overwhelming to keep all of these plates spinning, the answer is a surprisingly definitive no'. ""As musicians, we are entrepreneurs,"" she says.""You can't sleep on it; you can't let things go; you have to be on top of it."" Part of what keeps her fuelled up and ready to go is the energy and enthusiasm that comes from the space itself:""I'm just so excited to see what's going to happen as more and more people come to web3  more artists, more collectors and holders. It feels good that we're around at the start, that we can lay the foundations and be here when things pop off.""   ""Only 900 decided to buy my NFTs  but that was enough, because I found them.""    Violetta Zironi   Violetta may live on the frontier of web3's new career model, she may harness new tools and different techniques, yet, in a funny way, all this innovation builds upon the most simple and sturdy of foundations: the power of voice and instrument to bring people together and let them share in a moment of live music. It is the same creative energy that got Violetta started all those years ago in Regio Emilia. ""I remember playing on Twitter Spaces in front of my holders in America,"" she says.""I realised that they knew every word to my songs. They started singing and they basically took over the concert  I couldn't sing anymore because they were all singing.""  The true potential of technology lies in moments like those. The emotional power of music to forge real connections, even across vast distances, is the core of how artists like Violetta are moving the industry forward in web3.""The world is so big, but now we have the tools to reach anybody,"" says Violetta. ""I can play in American, South American, Australian or Japanese Twitter spaces. It's incredible. I really believe it doesn't matter what you do, so long as you find your people. I reached out to thousands and thousands over the last six months, and maybe only 900 decided to buy my NFTs  but that was enough, because I found them."" ",3402
" ""We believe people are interested in something that is unique for the ears as well as the eyes.""",weav,Fri Sep 23 2022 13:00:24,"Generative music, so far, hasn't left the same impact as generative art in web3 culture. Weav are trying to change that, making it easy for anyone to create a truly unique song. Clovis McEvoy speaks to Weav's Keit Kollo and Mansimran Singh about adaptive music in web3, making tools accessible, and their plans for the metaverse.",Fri Sep 23 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,music,Generative-Music; Metaverse,Clovis McEvoy," One of the biggest drawcards in web3 is adaptive content. NFTs that generate, rearrange, or reform with the click of a button  "" typically in unpredictable ways  "" make up some of the most exciting projects in the space. So far, this approach has been heavily tilted towards the visual domain; most music NFTs derive rareness from their accompanying artwork and only a handful of web3 musicians possess the know-how to bring dynamic audio to their fans.  Weav Music is looking to change that. Founded by Google Maps co-founder Lars Rasmussen, who now serves as an advisor to the company, Weav made a name for itself with Weav Run  "" an adaptive exercise app that takes songs by artists like Lizzo and Cardi B and dynamically shifts their mix, tempo, and arrangement to synchronise with your running speed. Now their attention has turned to web3, with a goal to bring adaptive audio NFTs to the world. ""We've been looking at the NFT market for a while now,"" says Weav Music's CEO, Keit Kollo.""We believe people are interested in something that is unique for the ears as well as the eyes, but a lot of the audio in music NFTs is basically the same as what you can buy on iTunes or stream on Spotify. So, we want to upgrade that experience and bring something new to the table.""   That upgraded experience rests on the company's own .weav audio format and the Weav Mixer, a free-to-use digital audio workstation (DAW) designed specifically for adaptive audio production. Using their mixer, Keit says users""can create a song and render it out in almost unlimited combinations, all unique, but all derivatives of the same underlying song.""  The Weav Mixer works with a song's stems'  "" such as the drums, bass, and vocals. These components, isolated as individual audio files, serve as the composable primitives' for dynamic music. In practice, this means that producers working in the Weav Mixer can use a data input to shift between instrument layers, change the sound mix, apply different audio effects, and vary the BPM.   Of course, other DAWs already exist with similar capabilities, and this hasn't, to date, translated into a surge of adaptive music NFTs. But that's partly because writing adaptive music is hard  "" much of the software to make it happen was pioneered by, and for, the video game industry, and composers generally need to learn specialised skills and techniques to use it. Breaking down this barrier of entry is an essential part of making adaptive music accessible for a larger group of artists  "" hence why Weav Music are shaping their tools not for composers and sound designers, but for bedroom producers.""Using our music engine,"" says Manisimran Singh, the company's CTO,""with a bit of tagging and production work you can turn any song into an adaptive song.""  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:75%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""75%"" data-rt-dimensions=""640:480"" data-page-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfTuj9xCXzA""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/WfTuj9xCXzA"" title=""Weav give Flo Rida's 'Low' the Weav Mixer treatment""></iframe> </figure> We'll soon get a practical demonstration of all this with Weav Music's forthcoming NFT collection. The release will focus on single songs, and all the different variations that can be spun out using the Weav Mixer. Tentatively scheduled to drop early next year, the collection is paired with an interactive music player that lets NFT holders dig into the different adaptive possibilities and see for themselves how the magic is made.  On the heels of this collection, Mansimran says the company is looking at ways to bring NFT functionality to the Weav Mixer.""There are so many things you can do when you have access to stems, effects, and mixes,"" he says.""We're currently experimenting with a few different NFT mechanics. We potentially won't get to a place where there's a single mint' button built in, but we will add more support, to a point where it's like here's this generic format, and these are all the different mechanics you can build into your NFT'.""  Keit and Mansimran believe that their format will not only be relevant to music NFTs as they exist today, but will also be a foundational element of future metaverse experiences  "" where 3D engines, video game mechanics, musicians, artist, and fans all coalesce. These multi-sensory spaces demand audio content that is not static, but can flow and adapt to match the surrounding environment, and the actions of users within them.""We believe our music engine can create truly interactive NFT experiences,"" says Mansimran.""Over time, this may broaden into a full metaverse where all music is shared, tokenised, traded, and listened to."" ""There's no question that music will be part of the culture of metaverse worlds  "" just like it is a part of every culture in this world,"" adds Keit.""Accordingly, we are educating artists about the short and long-term value of NFTs, in particular the value of interactive music collections.""  And it's blockchain technology that allows for the attribution to original  "" and subsequent  "" creators, removing a key obstacle for the presence of generative music across the space.""Today, those collections can offer artists new revenue streams while introducing their audiences to the world of blockchain and interactive music. In the coming months, songs in the .weav format will be portable into all kinds of metaverse worlds, offering artists opportunities to reach new audiences.""   ""So much remains yet to be imagined, let alone built.""    Keit Kollo, CEO Weav   Empowering musicians and producers to easily take existing, linear songs and remake them in a dynamic format  "" rather than needing to follow the long process of specifically writing adaptive music  "" would go a long way to addressing one of the creative bottlenecks that have kept adaptive music NFTs from keeping pace with their visual cousins.  Looking ahead to communities where fans collect, compare, and discuss different versions of their favourite songs, where the line between original' and remix' can shift in real time, and where a single song can adapt to suit transient, user created virtual spaces, it's hard not to get inspired. As Keit puts it:""We've only just begun to see the potential of the metaverse. So much remains yet to be imagined, let alone built."" ",1858
Web3 games need more controlled chaos,web3 games need more controlled chaos,Tue Sep 27 2022 20:02:46,"Web3 games aren't all that we hoped for yet. James Key argues that game developers have so far favoured monetisation over substance in the crypto space, Lea Rose Emeryding to a proliferation of dull, one-dimensional assets which holds them back from competing with classic AAA titles.",Thu Oct 06 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,community-society,Games; Opinion; Nft,James-key," A few days ago, a prominent NFT game consultant made the news by arguing that<a href=""https://decrypt.co/109203/nft-game-consultant-says-poor-people-could-be-npcs"" >""poor people"" can be used as NPCs</a> (non-playable characters) in future web3 games, essentially background characters. This is a dark vision of the future, and even as headlines everywhere continue to highlight the disappointment felt by gamers when it comes to blockchain games, we should not resort to converting cheap labour into digital background actors.  That being said, web3 games must find new ways to improve  "" or risk falling behind. With so many players dismissing today's play-to-earn games as blatant money grabs' or calling out their sub-par gameplay, there's little sign of the unhampered enthusiasm that accounted for the initial success of Axie Infinity and other similar projects. Web3 advocates understand that the future of the internet is being built on blockchain, but none of today's blockchain-based games come close to matching the immersiveness and fun of traditional top-level, AAA titles.  What's missing? For starters, some early web3 game developers may indeed be more interested in creating new ways to cash out than pushing the limits of actual gameplay. There are varied explanations for why this is the case, and while there are many familiar and credible criticisms of play-to-earn and other blockchain games, there's one crucial element that hasn't been widely acknowledged: a lack of spontaneity.  In the best traditional games, like  World of Warcraft  or  Grand Theft Auto , players can interact with various characters and elements within their in-game environment, in addition to one-another. In turn, these in-game environments and the NPCs that populate them are free to proactively initiate interactions with human players. The result is controlled chaos, as human players are subject to unexpected experiences, challenges, and outcomes. Depending on the situation an NPC may reach out to help you, distract you, or straight up kill you.  The quintessential unpredictability of traditional games provides an element of spontaneity that adds to the thrill of immersive gameplay. But blockchain game developers have failed to offer truly immersive and entertaining games up until now because they've lacked the tools required to create more playfully unpredictable experiences. The vast majority of game developers lack in-depth blockchain coding experience, and this has resulted in projects that are shallow and predictable versions of popular traditional games with a digital asset ownership' component tacked on. This is all changing with the advent of customisable on-chain automation.  Open-source automation tools make it possible for game developers to automate any on-chain action based on a wide range of pre-programmed conditions. This open-ended technology unlocks entirely new possibilities within the world of gaming. For instance, onchain automation enables the creation of<a href=""https://mirror.xyz/0x6B87AbC02Fc4E2406219C69ecE0280ca39476b31/6wGjQ-Saz4YUISqx3oXS1tQXLLOdXaC_WfFYKlqoq-Y"" > autonomous NFTs</a> that take the form of in-game NPCs. These automated NFT, or aNFT, NPCs can be programmed to behave in certain ways based on environmental parameters beyond a player's control, and even proactively initiate interactions with human players. A new breed of automated NPCs, they can be made to auto-transfer in and out of players' crypto wallets depending on in-game alliances, offer varying levels of support depending on how badly a player needs it, or even engage with other network protocols outside of the game in a gamified metaversal context.  Onchain automation is key to making web3 gaming mainstream.    James Key   In short, these automated NPCs are nothing like the static NFTs we see today. Automation in web3 has, for the most part, been missing in action, resulting in static, predictable gaming experiences. But as more revolutionary projects begin to offer off-the-shelf infrastructure for automation, game developers will finally be able to get as creative as they want through the introduction of independent, self-executing NPCs and other dynamic on-chain elements. On top of that, next-gen platforms like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/webaverse"" target=""_blank"">Webaverse</a> are augmenting their NPCs with artificial intelligence to produce AI-generated text responses.  The gaming industry are often early adopters of cutting-edge digital technologies, and it's time to discard the one-dimensional assets that saturate web3 games today in favour of something more exciting. There is no getting around the fact that most Web3-based games today are overly focused on profitability and ownership and less focused on engagement and actual fun. It's no wonder that play-to-earn continues to be hyped up by a sub-set of web3 enthusiasts who would stand to profit  "" but avoided like the plague by the broader gaming community. Onchain automation is key to making web3 gaming mainstream.  So if you're a gaming fan, rest assured  "" static NFTs and shallow experiences won't define web3 gaming for long, and developers can now leverage a growing suite of flexible automation tools to make future web3 games every bit as fun as traditional flagship titles. There's no reason to convince someone in a developing country to spice up our lives in some dystopian online""game"". Instead, we should believe in a future where players get the web3 games they deserve without creating a generation of digital servants. ",1591

Doing it""<a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/ed-balloon"">without the industry</a>"" became a rallying cry. In this new paradigm, labels were the problem and web3 the solution, or, in a milder version, the nature of web3 simply rendered traditional labels irrelevant.  Against this backdrop, the recent proliferation of web3's very own record labels might come as a surprise. Nonetheless, an increasing number of platforms are offering the same bundles of upfront capital, networking, artist management, PR, and distribution support that fundamentally characterises the record label. Some define themselves as such, some do not, but whether it's Coop Records, Good Karma Records, or The Hume Collective, something new is clearly taking shape in the web3 music industry. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1781px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1781px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/634840e8e2d1661d1c33375a_hume%20home.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://www.wearehume.com/#:~:text=we%20are%20reshaping%20what%20it%20means%20to%20be%20an%20artist%2C%20what%20it%20means%20to%20be%20a%20fan.""> Hume </a>  write that they are""reshaping what it means to be an artist, what it means to be a fan."" </figcaption></figure> Milo Lombardi, better known to the world as Nifty Sax, was one of the earliest pioneers in web3 music. A classically trained saxophonist, his <a href=""https://opensea.io/collection/niftysaxspheres""> Spheres </a> collection was an essential blueprint for how musicians could take full advantage of web3's capabilities to release engaging music NFTs. Not long after that initial drop, Milo, and co-founder Robin Spottiswoode, launched <a href=""https://niftymusic.app/"">Nifty Music</a>, the web3 music accelerator' behind some of the most well-crafted, and best-selling, music NFT collections in the world. ""It's a complete service,"" says Milo.""We create the project together with the artist, and then we can provide the strategy, the marketing, the technology, the whitelist, up to the creation of the project itself  "" i.e., the royalty structure and the generative aspect of the artworks.""  Asked whether it would be accurate to describe Nifty Music as a record label, Milo takes a moment before responding.""It is, in a sense, a label  "" but not in web2 terms. It's something new.""  One of the key differences that Milo sees is in how Nifty Music has built a following.""If you look at a proper label,"" he says,""you will have a style, a sound coming from that label because that's what they're looking to put out."" By comparison, Milo and Robin don't restrict themselves to any specific genre. Instead, a Nifty Music release is distinguished by how each collection is made.""We don't really care about the style of music,"" he explains.""What people look for in our drops is how cleverly they're put together  "" there's still a style but it's not in the sound of the music, it's the style of the drop. Maybe that's what a web3 label is: a style of drops that collectors can rely on.""   ""It is, in a sense, a label  "" but not in web2 terms. It's something new.""    Milo Lombardi, Nifty Sax, co-founder of Nifty Music   Another thing that's notably different is Nifty Music's approach to the financial side. Gone are the traditional record contracts that give labels an 80% cut of each sale and the artist 20%, gone is the transfer of master rights' that gives the label ownership of an artists' recordings for decades, or in some cases perpetuity, and gone are the long-term obligations that commit artists to multiple releases.  Instead, the first three artists who released with the company retained an astounding 80% cut of each primary sale. Moving forward, Milo says they've settled on a 35/65 split on primary sales in favour of the artist  "" to put that in context, even Kanye struggled to negotiate a 22% royalty cut with his label. It is also worth noting that the artist is under no obligation to stick with Nifty Music after their collection drops. In fact, Milo says it's their goal to help artists learn how to do it all themselves should they wish. ""That's our ethos,"" he says.""Ideally an artist who passes through us will have learned everything there is to know about making it on their own."" In keeping artists fully informed on the release process and developing the skills needed to go independent, Nifty Music's relationships with artists must necessarily be built on respect, shared vision, and mutually-realised gain  "" rather than on contractual obligations. Over the long-term, this creates a highly mobile artist; able to fluidly move between independent releases and label backing depending on their needs. For labels, this shifts their incentives to discovering new talent rather than focusing on already-established artists. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2200px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2200px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/634853d888ebf17dbd0626e3_Milo%20Lombardi%20(NiftySax)%20-%20Photo%20Credit%20to%20David%20Vendryes%20(5).jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Milo Lombardi wants to bring a new ethos to the music industry through Nifty Music. </figcaption></figure> The Nifty Music Academy is testament to this ethos, an educational arm of the company. Rather than the one-on-one working relationship they cultivate with artists like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/violetta-zironi"">Violetta Zironi</a> and Fifi Rong, who now have the freedom to strike out on their own, the Academy works with groups of twenty or so musicians to offer a similar learning experience but on a larger scale. ""It gives them all the same strategies and technology that we give to our professional artists, but in a classroom kind of environment,"" says Milo.""That way we can help more people at the same time."" For these students, Nifty Music takes no percentage but instead charges a single upfront fee, the same as any short academic course, payable at the beginning of the course or after their first drop.   ""Ideally an artist who passes through us will have learned everything there is to know about making it on their own.""    Milo Lombardi   Enterprises like Nifty Music are web3-natives, built by people who have been present in the space from its early days. At the same time, web2 labels are not sitting idle  "" increasingly, major industry forces are turning their attention to the potential of NFTs and making inroads into the web3 space.  Tony Barnes sees this as a potential positive for artists looking to scale up. A music industry veteran who is now co-founder and CMO at <a href=""https://karta.game/"">Karta</a>, a metaverse gaming studio with clients like Unilever and Fnatic, he notes that""record labels do invest large sums of money into developing an artist and, when it is done right, can do it on a global scale. Labels are not very good at the early phases of an artist's career, but once an artist has a solid fanbase and community, then they can be excellent at taking an artist to the next level.""  A music career is a multi-faceted endeavour that becomes ever more complex as artists scale up. Managing a highly successful music artist  "" one that consistently writes and records new material, regularly tours internationally, and undertakes global media campaigns - generally takes a team comprising several specialised contributors. It's at this level where some form of label support becomes more important.  Indeed, traditional labels are well placed to provide a bridge between the hundreds of millions of music consumers who use streaming subscription services in web2 and the small, passionate collector communities we see in web3. If even a small percentage of streaming subscribers can be converted to collectors, or if web3 artists can be given wider web2 exposure, then the space as a whole may benefit.  Of course, stepping into web3 is not an easy transition. There are fundamental differences between web2 and web3, not only with respect to the technological and legal structures, but also in terms of the philosophical underpinnings. As Cherie Hu <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/cheriehu42/status/1577008338679652352"">argues</a>, founder of the music research DAO Water &amp; Music, a clash of ideologies seems certain between those who have helped build web3 to its current state and web2 businesses looking to migrate. Tony anticipates similar issues, noting that traditional labels have a""major lack of understanding and mistrust of this space at senior level, and the tendency to apply outdated models to new technology.""  Rob Abelow has a foot in both camps. He's the owner of the independent music label <a href=""https://www.rollcallrecords.com/"" target=""_blank"">Roll Call Records</a> and recently founded <a href=""https://dopr.xyz/"" target=""_blank"">Dopr</a>, a web3 music discovery. He suggests that these knowledge gaps will be filled by third parties.""More traditional label setups can offer significant value to artists,"" says Rob.""But if they do not have web3 expertise or infrastructure, that should be offloaded to a team which does."" It's an approach that Rob says he's seeing""happen more and more.""  In some sense, the entry of labels into web3 was inevitable as soon as music artists began to successfully utilise the technology. Exactly how web3-native labels will grow over time, or how web2 labels will fare in this space, is difficult to predict. Much will ultimately depend on artists and how they themselves define success'. In a sense, web3 is a vindication of Kevin Kelly's <a href=""https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/"">1000 True Fans</a> hypothesis: with the internet, creators only need to find a thousand core fans to earn a comfortable wage.  However, for web3 artists who dream of stadium gigs and sold-out world tours, or even more than a five-figure salary, the resources of major labels still hold the key.""[Major labels] have huge teams,"" says Tony.""Passionate and experienced experts in 50-plus markets in the world  "" digital, marketing, commercial, brands, radio, press  "" all working on a local level to promote an artist and their music."" It's this success at scale where doing it on your own' is unlikely to cut it. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/634856051b7b530401653b41_Rob%20Abelow.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption><em>Rob Abelow expects labels to play an influential role in web3 music. </figcaption></figure> At the same time, listeners themselves will also play a large role going forward. To date, web3 music has embraced a DIY, almost punkish' aesthetic of lo-fi music production, unfiltered dialogue between fan and creator, and stripped-back concerts streamed on Twitter Spaces. By comparison, web2's pop stars seem to exist beyond the realm of mere mortals, their music lavishly produced and their concerts bursting with spectacle. As these two fan groups intermingle, it's hard to say who will influence who. Should web3 music consumers begin to place a premium on slick, professionally-produced content, then, once again, some sort of loosely defined label' will almost certainly be needed. At the same time, the direct connection and distinct lack of pedestal is a key part of what makes web3 a thriving environment for fans and simultaneously taps into the growing role of <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/aug/21/its-a-modern-day-facebook-how-bereal-became-gen-zs-favourite-app"">authenticity</a> in our online lives. ""Labels, or something that looks like labels, will likely continue to be integral in scaling artists,"" says Rob. However, he adds that""labels will continually need to re-evaluate how they can provide value to artists as the market changes."" As web3 music and the organisations that support it continue to take shape, one thing is certain: this space has reinvigorated an ongoing conversation regarding the balance of power in the music industry, a conversation that may ultimately result in a fundamental reset of the artist-label relationship.

Web3 mobile and a new route to global adoption,web3 mobile,Mon Oct 17 2022 13:35:29,Using web3 today comes with extensive frictions that hold back global adoption. Vlad Falin explains how web3's mobile innovations can remove them by rebuilding the operating systems they run on and profiles the Lea Rose Emeryding mainstream manufacturers and web3-natives who are making it happen.,Thu Oct 27 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,community-society,Blockchain; Mobile; Industry-Trends,Vlad," Powered by decentralised finance, non-fungible tokens, and decentralised autonomous organizations, the core features of web3's most recent cycle are indicators for how blockchain can permeate every sector of the economy. However, the hype has been tempered by the realities that every maturing technology needs to overcome: simplifying complexity to pave the way to mainstream adoption.   One of the great frontiers in the web3 adoption game comes in the form of mobile devices, a route through which the space can abstract complexity away into a device's operating system, and do so via the planet's most successful consumer device.  In 2022, almost <a href=""https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world"">7 billion people</a> will own a smartphone, making it the ideal platform to reach the individuals across the globe. But as much as mobile represents an alternative route to the mainstream, conventional smartphones cannot access blockchain networks without using third-party apps and services, which is even more of an obstacle on the smaller screen.  Most users are reticent to download a crypto wallet, take responsibility for their own security, and go through multiple clicks to sign a transaction. Mobile presents an opportunity to remove much of the friction of web3 by integrating it into a device's hardware and operating system, thus opening the doors to millions more exploring crypto.  Today, established phone-makers and leading blockchains alike are pouring resources into mobile. In addition to abstracting away much of the complexity in web3, blockchain on mobile can enable a number of tangible use cases, including truly anonymised instant messaging, mobile mining, and making it easy to pay with crypto via your phone.  The Solana Saga   Last June, Solana Labs announced the launch of <a href=""https://solanamobile.com/"" >Saga</a>, an Android phone augmented by a native integration to the Solana blockchain. It allows users to store digital assets, install web3 applications via the Solana 'dApp Store', and pay with crypto of fiat via Solana Pay. Solana has also promised to include a mobile wallet adapter and a seed vault to optimise seed phrase management.  Meanwhile, the design choice to build on Android rather than starting afresh means that the phone will come with an operating system that most phone users are used to, plus features like the Google Play Store to retain the rich ecosystem of existing mobile apps. The high-end phone (it has the latest Snapdragon processor and 12gb RAM) is available for pre-order, with customers required to pay a $100 deposit and a further $900 in early 2023, when devices are expected to begin shipping. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:3500px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""3500px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/635c3e682197dbdd81a44695_solana%5D.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko holds up a prototype of Saga, the  <a href=""https://twitter.com/solanamobile/status/1540066889518432257""> Solana phone </a> . </figcaption></figure> Beyond making it easy for users to access the web3 ecosystem, the company is making a complementary push to bring developers onto the platform. The Solana Mobile Stack (SMS) includes a software development kit designed to make creating Solana mobile dApps as easy as creating an Android app without losing the benefits of building blockchain applications.  A new ethos   Whilst the first Solana phones are expected next year, the Ethereum operating system is already in use today on select devices. <a href=""https://www.ethereumphone.org/#install-container"" >Available for installation</a> on three legacy Google Pixel devices, ethOS is optimised for crypto-native individuals with native Ethereum dapps, Ethereum Name Service (ENS) capability, crypto payments, and NFT display and minting support.  However, it must be noted that ethOS isn't built from scratch, given the technical complexity it would entail. Like Solana, it is built on Android, letting users interact with web3 apps and perform transactions for cryptocurrencies and NFTs using a built-in crypto wallet. Moreover, ethOS makes it easy for users to operate light nodes from their phone, less intensive and complex nodes that still contribute to the decentralisation of the network.  Ultimately, the goal behind ethOS is to eventually create a physical Ethereum-based phone, but the dev team has given no timeframe on its roadmap at time of writing.  HTC in the Metaverse   Saga and ethOS demonstrate how blockchain leaders see the importance of a mobile approach to web3 adoption. But major mobile manufacturers are paying attention too. Amongst them is HTC, who have bet on web3 with its Exodus 1 smartphone, a BNB Chain-native phone a own wallet app, Zion, that is integrated with Binance's crypto exchange, a dApp ecosystem to download decentralised applications on BSC, and a social key recovery systems to provide recourse in the event of losing your private keys.  Exodus 1 was released in 2018, and the Taiwanese company has followed up on its blockchain venture with the HTC Desire 22 last July, billed to let users ""enter the metaverse"" via extended reality (XR). Developed to integrate seamlessly with the company's metaverse and VR platform, Viverse, it is another example of how existing consumer tech companies are feeling out the potential and demand for web3-powered mobile devices.  Probably Nothing   Meanwhile, Nothing, the phone manufacturer established by OnePlus co-founded Carl Pei, have partnered with the Ethereum sidechain Polygon to create the manufacturer's first mobile phone, Phone (1). Founded in 2020 and labelled ""the most hyped tech company in years"" by <a href=""https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/article/nothing-carl-pei-ear-1"">GQ</a>, Phone (1) integrates crypto payments, storage, access to Polygon dApps, and Polygon's ID system. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1901px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1901px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/635c414211500581e51b4e45_ezgif.com-gif-maker%20(3).jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > A model demonstrates the the glyph interface on the  <a href=""https://nothing.tech/pages/phone-1""> Nothing Phone (1) </a> . </figcaption></figure> Available at a more accessible price point than Saga from ¬£399, the Nothing team is more engaged in web3 principles than HTC's Exodus, where the web3 focus is largely reserved for wallet management, making a leading phone manufacturer in the web3 space. By contrast, <a href=""https://blog.polygon.technology/polygon-partner-with-tech-company-nothing-to-enable-web3-functionality/"">Polygon's involvement</a> allows the manufacturer ""to make all of Nothing's products future-ready by supporting sustainable and secure access to web3 applications.""  Though it won't be available in North America (due to <a href=""https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-us-carrier-support"">difficulty</a> obtaining cellular coverage), Nothing has laid down a marker with the release of Phone (1) last August. The brand sold over 100,000 units in India within a month of that date, but hasn't released global sales figures yet.  What Is Next For Web3 Mobile?   There's no question that web3 will continue to gain mindshare across industry verticals as the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries mature and gain greater adoption in the coming years. And it appears that mobile will be one of the great frontiers in the space's growth, enabling a wave of adoption by abstracting away the complexity of core blockchain tools. Samsung is amongst the mainstream manufacturers to have built in crypto features to new releases, with their <a href=""https://decrypt.co/19115/samsungs-new-galaxy-s20-will-have-cryptocurrency-support"">Galaxy S20</a> also able to store cryptocurrencies.  ""Mobile will be one of the great frontiers in the space's growth.""  This growth will begin with Android and will likely retain ties to the Google-built ecosystem for many years, given its rich developer ecosystem. By contrast, it's hard to see a future today in which Apple supports web3 protocols, with the Cupertino company preferring to keep blockchain innovations within its own walled gardens, such as charging a <a href=""https://blockworks.co/apple-allows-nft-sales-on-its-app-store-but-theres-a-catch/"" >30% commission</a> on NFT sales made via iOS apps.  But the possibilities are exciting  "" the first models of web3 mobile devices offer a look at how web3 itself might force a rethink on how to overcome its biggest challenges. The reorientation of web3 towards mobile platforms is one of the major trends to follow in 2023 and beyond. ",2565
Web3 x Hollywood: Can NFTs usher in a New Golden Age of cinema?,web3 x hollywood and a new golden age of cinema,Fri Jul 08 2022 18:17:08,"Mark Fielding journeys through the nascent film3 sector and, scouting both innovation and areas on which to improve, explores the ways that film and web3 have the potential to be a truly impactful and innovative combination.",Sun Jul 10 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,film,Long-Reads; Opinion,Mark Fielding,"   ""Hollywood is a place where they'll pay you a thousand dollars for a kiss and fifty cents for your soul.""     Marilyn Monroe   Sorry Marilyn, but for all the kisses, Hollywood is more like an oil tanker. It's not that it's dank, hot, and funded by nefarious megalomaniacs, but rather that it's difficult to change course. Anyone who has watched the dream factory rely on brute force over agility during the digital transformation over the past twenty-five years can attest to that. One of Hollywood's earliest attempts to stem the flood of peer-to-peer streaming and retain control of distribution was to <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/1/9241811/popcorn-time-oregon-lawsuit-survivor"">sue</a> children for a hundred thousand dollars. When that failed  "" and the ensuing explosion of online streaming sites jeopardised the billion dollar apple cart  "" studios doubled down on the financial guarantee of sequels (<a href=""https://www.filmstories.co.uk/features/107-movie-sequels-currently-on-the-way/"">117</a> currently in development) and superhero movies. It <a href=""https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/"">worked</a>, but now web3 is making an appearance on Hollywood the disrupt the dream makers.  A Fistful of Dollars  James Cameron outliers aside, the average Hollywood movie costs $125 million to produce. Indie filmmakers, by contrast, jostle in the dust. According to the American Film Market, the average independent movie costs between $10,000 and $1 million to make. Chump change. Money has always pushed independent filmmakers to the fringes, scrambling for funding, scrambling for distribution, scrambling for survival.   Web3 is oft touted as a solution to this imbalance; NFTs a funding mechanism to nullify the studio dominance that has existed since Nestor Studios first opened its doors in 1911; DAOs a governance model to disrupt who writes, directs, and stars in the film.   It was Thursday, it was raining, and I had just watched  Top Gun: Maverick . I felt¶ cheated, and decided to find out what this web3 alternative looked like. I was immediately caught in a tweetstorm of excitement. Everyone was screaming about paradigm shifts, new eras, change, and freedom.  ""We're at the forefront,"" they shouted.""Breaking ground, creating a new cinematic world of storytelling, and vision and IP ownership in the hands of the creators. The traditional Hollywood funding model is dead, dead, dead.""   ""My prediction is that within 2 years, nearly every movie will have an NFT fundraising element.""  <a href=""https://mobile.twitter.com/FilmicNFT/status/1541426101419151362""> Some </a>  are getting very excited about the about the potential for web3 films to take over Hollywood.   Every screenwriter is told to show, not tell. The audience demands action, not exposition. Claiming the future of Hollywood is a decentralised storytelling utopia is one thing, but who was filming this paradigm shift? I typed web3 NFT movie' into Google¶ and was immediately asked to hand over ¬£1,100 for an NFT (‚Ç¨1,250/$1,280). Oh yeah, NFTs. Rather than click away, I read on; they wanted me to become co-producer after all. The film was called Plush, the first animated feature-length film to be funded by NFTs. ¬£1,100 might sound like a lot, but co-producers would split an 80% share of worldwide box office profits. Hurrah! Count me in. But then I remembered that 8 out of 10 movies never make a profit. That still gave me a 20% chance of making 80% of something  "" and something is better than nothing, even if there was an 80% chance it would be nothing.  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1578px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1578px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62c864cfdcc58660fbf94e58_3fw9uXZX2ZigQRvCrH9CCpP1hhKVDUcOA_usHcuzxJPFqEjBxcV_NrrFmw09QwWOgeACqZcj9DIgJsulO9iKi1LWt4GJekl1Q_tjVwAyT8Bzi6KnTM88cwzCl2OVc-FUiBzHwvl0dugo19NhNsQEIuk.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://twitter.com/plush_nft""> Plush </a>  is the first animated feature-length film financed by an NFT collection. </figcaption></figure> Details, details.

From Hart's Twitter feed I learned Reese Witherspoon, another Oscar winner, has a production company called Hello Sunshine, investing in films that feature female-led NFT collections, whilst Sir Ridley Scott is using NFTs to fund <a href=""https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2022/06/06/ridley-scott-ethereum-nfts/""> The Infinity Machine </a>, a film about Vitalik Buterin, NFTs, and the rise of Ethereum.   I had legitimate proof that Hollywood heavyweights were experimenting  "" as they should be  "" and was once again enthused by web3's potential to change the script. It wasn't necessarily a new golden age of cinema, but definitely a movement.   <strong >The never ending story</strong>  Disney, Paramount, Sony, Universal, and Warner Bros control 79% of the movie market in <a href=""https://www.statista.com/topics/4394/movie-studios/"">North America</a>; Europe is scarcely different. That's depressing. How many people in the world can green-light a Hollywood movie? Twenty? Thirty? Whatever the answer is, it's not enough.   Rather than five studios dictating what we all watch and who makes it, in web3 there could be hundreds  "" thousands even  "" of small communities all making films. If the story plays out as intended, not only will fans be able to get the film made, but they'll be able to write the script, help choose the director and actors, and vote on whether the caterers serve prawn cocktail or smoked tofu at lunch.   Mathew Lillard, one of the murderers in the first <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS4pqr0_qYI&ab_channel=mrscouser22"">Scream</a> movie, co-created <a href=""https://midnitemovieclub.com/""> The Midnight Movie Club </a>, a decentralised studio where the community decides which projects are funded and who directs them. <a href=""https://moviecoin.com/"">Moviecoin</a> has a similar vision, using the DeFi protocol Uniswap to fund investment rather than NFTs.

My editor has just told me that half of our readers don't have kids, so I'll mention the Nite School instead, an online campus with AMAs, courses, and on-the-ground film-making lessons.  Indeed, what about the film-makers themselves? Could web3 help screenwriters and directors from underserved and underprivileged communities, shunned by the existing Hollywood model of guaranteed gains and safe choice, break through? Can it give them a platform for their art?   Jordan Bayne, founder of the <a href=""https://twitter.com/nftfilmsquad"">NFT Film Squad</a>, has coined the term 'film3' to describe this ecosystem of movie-minded creators. <a href=""https://www.culture3.com/posts/julie-pacino"">Julie Pacino</a> is a fan.

""Through the use of our platform currency, FILMCredits, and powered by incentive mechanisms, our ecosystem enables decentralised participation, crowdsourced curation, and, eventually, autonomous financing. In doing so, it creates an alternative to the traditional system that defines the film industry today.""  In Hollywood, too few people make too many decisions. Web3 provides independent filmmakers, storytellers, and voices with the resources and opportunities to fund films in an innovative way. It gives talent that would never get close to Hollywood via traditional channels an opportunity that can soon become the dream factory's equal. I'm not sure democratic is the right word  "" and a golden era it certainly isn't, for now  "" but web3 opens the doors on a fairer, more enlightened, and more diverse movie making industry.

But with attention from major players like Facebook and Microsoft, it's natural to worry how original the technology will be. Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg dives into Webaverse, the democratised, interoperable, and cross-platform software that CEO Ahad Shams plans to turn into the operating system of the open metaverse.",Fri Sep 30 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,metaverse,Vr-Ar; Blockchain; Internet-Of-Things; Artificial-Intelligence; Infrastructure,Randy Ginsburg," Although the broader crypto market has seen a significant downturn, the metaverse is vying for its position as one of the top buzzwords of 2022. Corporations and investors alike are pouring money into metaverse-related companies  "" $120 billion in the first five months of 2022, to be exact, more than double the $57m invested throughout 2021  "" aiming to get in on what's promised by many to be the next major shift in how people use the internet.  Only made possible by a foundation of emerging technologies like VR/AR, blockchain, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence, the metaverse is widely expected to unlock new business models and transform interactions between customers and companies. Virtual and augmented reality lies at the core of the metaverse, providing the technology that underlies newly immersive experiences, but it is just one component of a full metaverse vision. This vision for the future of the internet also relies on blockchain to transport digital assets across different digital worlds, Internet of Things technology to connect the real world with their digital twins, and artificial intelligence to augment the creativity and operational capabilities of those active in the space.  But given the nascency of the technology, the true nature of the metaverse remains largely undefined and leaves much up for interpretation. What  is  the metaverse? Truly, nobody knows.  Yet even with its loose definition, few organisations are working as hard to define  "" and bring about  "" its future than Webaverse. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:6523px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""6523px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/633d64695a2f99597a4b169b_poster_3_banner%20(1).jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > For us, it was going back to the ideals of the basic internet,"" says Ahad.""Open for all, accessible, no walled garden."" </figcaption></figure> While many metaverse maximalists envision a Ready Player One-Esque future where humans will spend the bulk of their waking hours interacting within fully immersive digital worlds, the Webaverse team see a different path.  Webaverse co-founder and CEO Ahad Shams <a href=""https://webaverse.ghost.io/ikigai/"">describes</a> his view of the metaverse as simply a merging of the virtual and digital worlds. Rather than building the internet completely anew, Ahad proposes a different future: one in which our 2D text-based applications will evolve with new user experiences around interaction, engagement, and immersion.  Bringing this to reality will require a delicate balance of user-generated and AI-generated content, capable of being experienced across platforms, and allowing any user to guide AI-design tools and create their own worlds.""The less crazy part is what humans experience in digital worlds, the more consequential part is how virtual beings and digital content (not made by humans) proliferate across all mediums,"" he predicts. This is exactly that vision that Webaverse is working tirelessly to bring to life.  A fully inter-operable vision   Founded as a collective of artists, builders, and creatives, <a href=""https://webaverse.com/"" >Webaverse</a> is the world's first browser-based metaverse-ready engine. Built around open-source ingredients and standard file formats, Webaverse can be experienced across any format you can think of, from 2D and 3D, to <a href=""https://twitter.com/webaloot/status/1556863467264802817"">more futuristic ambitions</a> like virtual and augmented reality, and across any platform, whether it's a laptop, a phone, or a console.  Webaverse's ultimate goal? Become an open-source operating system for the metaverse, allowing users to build fully customisable and immersive worlds, games, and applications with no technical experience. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:56.199999999999996%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""56.199999999999996%"" data-rt-dimensions=""500:281"" data-page-url=""https://twitter.com/untitledxyz_/status/1555220882884370433""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=96f1f04c5f4143bcb0f2e68c87d65feb&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/untitledxyz_/status/1555220882884370433&image=https%3A//abs.twimg.com/errors/logo46x38.png"" title=""untitled, xyz on Twitter: &quot;I just built a solo @MuseumofCrypto ROOM for my @XCOPYART Grifter and then dropped the mapped .glb directly into @webaverse to walk (fly) around it.

At the same time, Webaverse is solving many of the prevalent issues with today's multi-siloed and fragmented internet landscape, providing users with radical transparency around user data, democratising access through open-source code and cross-platform access,the democratization of technology, and a frictionless right of exit, being built on public chains and standards, allowing for the sale of game assets.  For us, it was going back to the ideals of the basic internet,"" says Ahad.""Open for all, accessible, no walled garden. This isn't built on Unity or Unreal (two major 3D game development platforms). We know that the next evolution of computing will be cross-platform and cross-medium. We're making it super easy for user-generated content to exist in conjunction with the app.""  In our ever-evolving world of abundance, content and data have become king. But in most cases, citizens of the internet own neither. Instead, big tech companies and major gaming studios have all of the power, dictating how our data is used and how content can be shared.  This is no better illustrated than in the gaming world, where a massively disproportionate one-sided value exchange between gamers and game creators exists. For years, gamers have invested ample time, money, and effort into their games of choice with little to no ability to generate value from their contributions or in-game performance. Now, by bringing user-generated content and in-game assets onto the blockchain, players can finally own and receive ongoing value from their digital assets. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/633762d120ddae97c2524bed_web4.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > An early look at how Webaverse looks.

Within seconds, users can generate mind-blowingly detailed images by inputting a single line of text. Building in-game assets inside procedural worlds are the only logical next step.  ç The Webaverse Ecosystem   While building an engine for creators to launch their own games, Webaverse is setting the tone with a game of their own, Upstreet. Dubbed as Final Fantasy meets Roblox, Upstreet is a 3D, evolving, massive multiplayer online (MMO) experience where creators and different communities can build and monetise their own worlds, games, and immersive applications.  Set in a world approaching technological singularity, Upstreet releases new elements of the storyline in a season format, where users have the ability to create user-generated content that influences the plot's trajectory. As the first few seasons conclude, all the data will be fed into Webaverse's internal AI engines to procedurally generate the next season.  While much of Upstreet is still under development, the Webaverse team has big plans for the game and its supporting marketplace, along with a separate 2D game that will be released later next year. Upstreet relies heavily on the blockchain for microtransactions and immutability with respect to digital ownership and provenance. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:56.206088992974244%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""56.206088992974244%"" data-rt-dimensions=""854:480"" data-page-url=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4YUeIRjUxg""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/L4YUeIRjUxg"" title=""Webaverse Explainer""></iframe> </figure>""We're not trying to look at traditional games and make a better game with crypto. We are making a genre of games that haven't existed,"" he said.""Not only will we make the game, but the entire engine, so that all games built on the engine will be interoperable.""  This interoperability will begin within the Upstreet ecosystem itself, allowing players to bring their same avatar, inventory, and assets to both Upstreet and Webaverse's soon-to-be-announced 2D game. And in the future, all other games built on the engine too.  Trends for the future ç  But ambitious visions like the Webaverse come with no shortage of skepticism and growing pains. Building a fun and exciting, interoperable version of the metaverse on internet-native principles also means fending off the web2 juggernauts who envision the metaverse as part of their existing internet conquest. It also means navigating many of the same societal issues that these tech giants still face today, few less tangible than content moderation.  As the Webaverse opens up the floodgates of society's collective imagination, there will need to be strategic guardrails in place for moderation. And given the ethos of openness and decentralisation in the web3 space that Webaverse calls home, this may be a tough pill to swallow for some. ""These are things which our entire team thinks very deeply about. I'm pro-freedom in general, and principally we want to be completely open, but pragmatically how do we do it in such a way which doesn't go too far? We want to build a safe and positive community, but these are difficult things to solve for.""  It's important to note that while Webaverse has released a handful of impressive teasers, the project is still very much under development. Its grand vision won't appear overnight, and it will even take some time for the ideal user experience to materialise across platforms. Still, that hasn't stopped early users from <a href=""https://twitter.com/loomdart/status/1557043657219330048?s=20&t=yazNxBZtyN1nHRxUr1fTbg"" >enjoying and building on the platform</a>.   ""The metaverse should be a sum of our collective imagination.""    Ahad Shams   In the meantime, the Webaverse team will continue to innovate, launching smaller products along the way, all of which will feed into the larger world-building experience, and continue to improve Webaverse's AI model.  Ahad blossoms with excitement.""Within the next year or two, thanks to tools like the Webaverse, creativity will flourish. We will see an abundance of AI-generated content, movies, and virtual productions. ""AAA games which used to have budgets of 50 to 100 million will come down significantly. The metaverse should be a sum of our collective imagination and we are finally headed in that direction.""  ",3384
Welcome to the Commune.xyz  how DAOs are driving a renaissance of countercultural living,welcome to the commune,Tue Aug 02 2022 09:58:09,Mission-centric organisations are finding that DAOs can help them realise their vision. Ola Kalejaye Kalejaye explores the people creating the communes of the future.,Tue Aug 02 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,communities-augmented,Daos; Creator-Communes,Ola Kalejaye," There's a likely majority of people who, when they think of NFTs, think of pixelated avatars and cartoon JPEGs selling for ostensibly outrageous sums of money. Predictably, it's this sector of NFTs  "" frequently criticised for its speculative investing, aspects of greed, and countless scams  "" that has dominated the conversation for brands, builders, and consumers alike.  However, while recent downturns in cryptocurrency and NFT markets have taken the air out of that side of web3, other sectors with different agendas have continued to build and grow. It's here that we find the vastly expanding catalogue of DAOs, and the people building them.   In the world of web3, DAOs are a new way of organising. They're run by their members, where membership is purchased through NFTs and governance tokens, with the latter serving as voting shares in the organisation.   The idea with DAOs is that members can actively participate in their organisation's governance, democratising decision-making and resources beyond a small, centralised group of individuals.  Notably, many of the DAOs forming today are mission-driven in nature with a cause at the center of their roadmap. For such value-centric organisations, DAOs represent a powerful tool to achieve both group consensus and group fundraising. Included in this category are DAOs coalescing around philosophies of co-living and IRL community. And as much as they're pioneering a new path powered by the blockchain, they're also taking a page from community movements of the past.  Flexible web3 infrastructure begets a wide variety of DAOs   During the mid-20th century, communes became a way to opt out of contemporary society. Particularly common in the United States, the country was host to almost 3,000 of them in the 60s and 70s. The commune movement, which arose from protests against the Vietnam War and dovetailed with the civil rights movement, was essentially an alternative dream for the reality of capitalist consumerism.  Several DAOs are fostering a rebirth of the hippie commune, perhaps stemming from a broader critique of capitalism's effect on wealth inequality today. Integrating a high-tech spin, DAOs are interesting in part because of the potential to blend cutting-edge blockchain technology with old-school hippie communes built on good old fashioned collaboration.  Indeed, as with the original""hippies"", the tech-savvy digital hippies of today are taking stock of structures and systems that seem to be failing under the pressures of life today. In contrast to many initiatives in web3, these commune-like DAOs are looking to the blockchain to help address how we collaborate with one another in the physical world. as opposed to the virtual one.  Most people involved in the building of DAOs are quick to note that they aren't interested in reinventing the wheel. At the end of the day, there is a rich history of non-profits, co-operatives, and communes to draw ideas from. What these DAOs are hoping to do is to leverage blockchain technology to increase the efficiency of their operations and increase their capacity to achieve their goals.   DAO tools like governance and voting rights bring structure to mission-driven organisations that rely on community contributions. In the past, communities needed in-person meetings and pen-and-paper organisation to get things done. But in our current reality of post-pandemic asynchronous work, you can cast your vote remotely and Zoom into meetings. Certainly, technology is always changing how we work; web3 is just another technological shift. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:806px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""806px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62e90a49e6ef0cabbf8dbe4f_Screenshot_2.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><em>A  <a href=""https://thenetworkstate.com/""><em>network state </a><em> is an online community that crowdfunds territory internationally and<br>gains diplomatic recognition from existing states, according to Balaji Srinivasan. </figcaption></figure> By the same token, NFTs serve as tools to both drive revenue and prove membership. They're digital membership cards and a channel through which communities can communicate and share value with their members. So where are the DAOs of today building on the legacy of the 20th century commune? In the proliferating ecosystem of web3, they're only growing in number every day.  In his recently released book  The Network State , entrepreneur and web3 thought leader Balaji Srinivasan outlines his vision of how decentralised groups can organise themselves and evolve, culminating in""Network States"", a diplomatically-recognised entity that he believes will succeed nation states. The former Coinbase CTO and a16z general partner runs a Network State <a href=""https://thenetworkstate.com/dashboard"">dashboard</a> to track start-up societies that align with the Network State framework. There are currently 23 groups on the dashboard, several of which are DAOs that one easily connects to older commune models.  Will DAOs build the communes of the future?  Take <a href=""https://www.creatorcabins.com/"">CabinDAO</a>, whose goal is to create a decentralised city for creators. As innovative and forward-looking as this sounds, take away the technology and CabinDAO ultimately feels a lot like traditional communes. People live together, chip in what they can, and help build co-living spaces. Like many DAOs in this category, physical properties owned by the DAO where members can congregate and live are a vital part of its ambitious vision of the future.  Elsewhere on the spectrum of alternative living groups is the startup-turned-DAO, <a href=""https://kiftdao.xyz/"">Kift</a>. The DAO, which uses a collection of NFT Kiftables as its membership token, is creating a network of DAO-owned community houses in picturesque locations. Starting with four houses across the American West coast, Kift blends co-living, remote work, and the growing trend of vanlife for its vision of geo-distributed cities.  In an interview with Bloomberg, Kift's CEO Colin O'Donnell spoke about the kind of fundamental shift that DAOs like Kift hope to facilitate.""We used to spend all day sitting with our co-workers and chatting with our friends online. Now we spend all day with our friends and chat with our co-workers online. It feels like a better situation."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1764px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1764px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62e908a325a5a0d0a82cdff7_kiftables.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption ><em>KiftDAO wants to acquire, build, and celebrate co-creation and co-living communities. </figcaption></figure> O'Donnell dreams of building a geo-distributed city. One where people live a life more in tune with their surrounding environment and in community with their neighbors, all while maintaining the flexibility to get out and explore new locales to their hearts' content.   It may indeed be a lofty goal, but it's one that Kift's first cohort of members share. By setting Kift up as a DAO, O'Donnell hopes that those members will also share the challenge of deciding how to build it.  Certainly, the broader web3 movement could learn a thing or two from DAOs like these, for whom the technology is simply a tool, rather than the product being celebrated in and of itself. In an interview with The New Yorker, CabinDAO co-founder Jonathan Hillis explained,""we didn't intend to be a DAO. The DAO tools were the best tools to accomplish what we were trying to accomplish.""  The expressly countercultural wing of web3 is likely to continue growing within the overall space. And with that will come organisations that look to shake up the status quo in new and exciting ways. Real-world activism, organising, and protest have been powerful ways to start movements in the past, but can they now be started  "" and sustained  "" in the digital world?  Perhaps you can Zoom into a DAO meeting to discuss new forms of governance, buy an NFT to vote on treasury allocation, and take your hard-earned online relationships from the metaverse to the physical world.  After all, even hippies have Wi-Fi these days. ",2414

Limited decentralisation, scalability issues, and a ponzi perception problem. Allen Taylor analyses three of the biggest criticisms made of web3, and explores whether they're fair, how close we are to fixing them, and if we need to worry.",Tue Sep 27 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,community-society,Blockchain; Opinion,Allen Taylor," Judging from various criticisms of web3, one might think it has a perception problem. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey argues it looks a lot like web2. He <a href=""https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098"" >tweeted last December</a> that venture capitalists (VC), not the collective""we,"" own the space. Never mind that it was VC money which turned Twitter into a web2 powerhouse; if anything, that shows he knows what startup capital strings look like. His perspective is a credible one, but it's only partially true. Meanwhile, the common critique that blockchains will find it hard to scale to a size that makes them useful ignores much of the innovation already occurring in the space. And of course, the accusation that web3 is just a new source for ponzi schemes doesn't tell the full story.  Web3 and decentralisation  Jack's criticism of web3 has more to do with the decentralisation than it does with money. One of the reasons investors throw money at a company is to influence its growth and development. That's venture capital's upside, the reward for helping cash-strapped entrepreneurs toward a profitable conclusion.  The downside is that this is exactly how it works. It costs money to build things, and someone must foot the bill. That usually involves trading equity for capital, borrowing money for operating expenses, or self-funding. It works that way in every industry. Why should web3 be different? As much as web3 likes to suggest that ownership in the space is decentralised, and thus free from gatekeeping, venture capital <a href=""https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/venture-capitalists-are-pouring-money-into-web3-heres-why/433195"">forms a large part of the ownership structures</a> at most major web3 organisations. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:56.199999999999996%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""56.199999999999996%"" data-rt-dimensions=""500:281"" data-page-url=""https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?type=text%2Fhtml&key=c4e54deccf4d4ec997a64902e9a30300&schema=twitter&url=https%3A//twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098&image=https%3A//abs.twimg.com/errors/logo46x38.png"" title=""jack on Twitter: &quot;You don't own &quot;web3.&quot;The VCs and their LPs do. It will never escape their incentives. It's ultimately a centralized entity with a different label. Know what you're getting into... / Twitter&quot;""></iframe> </figure> The debate over web3 funding has grown into such a passionate fistfight simply because insiders so heavily tout decentralisation as the princess at the ball. And if decentralisation is the core benefit of web3, it makes sense to critically question how we get there. If developers can't make a product that funds itself through the benefits it delivers, or wants financing to bootstrap its early growth, their options are limited to outside assistance. The payoff could be a loss of the core benefit of decentralisation as financiers demand a greater say in product development and business strategy.  In other words, it is understandable to argue that web3 technology will either pay for itself, or VC money will make its demands. After all, these are largely the same financiers who funded the horde of dominant web2 applications. Why should anyone be surprised they want to own web3?  However, to an extent, this argument betrays what one might call a 'web2 mindset'. The problem is that it underestimates the impact that early community members can have on the products that they use. This is not just a web3 argument: community-owned enterprises predate the internet by a long way. In the US, Benjamin Franklin introduced <a href=""https://employeeownershipfoundation.org/blogs/the-history-of-employee-ownership"" >employee ownership</a> to his own enterprises long before the American Revolution, whilst the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochdale_Principles"">Rochdale Principles</a> pioneered the <a href=""https://www.uk.coop/understanding-co-ops/how-co-ops-began"">modern cooperative movement</a> in 19th century Britain, and which were formalised <a href=""https://www.woccu.org/about/history"">in Germany</a> around a similar time. Communities from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uralungal_Labour_Contract_Co-operative_Society"">India</a> to <a href=""https://coops4dev.coop/en/4devamericas/brazil"">Brazil</a> have owned organisations from banks and utility companies to grocery shops and land trusts.  As a way of organising, cooperatives are not to be ignored. The International Cooperative Alliance estimates that <a href=""https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/facts-and-figures"">12% of the entire global population</a> is a member of some form of cooperative, one of every eight people. One of the most interesting is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REI"">Recreational Equipment Inc.</a> (REI)  "" a consumer cooperative with revenues of $2.9bn  "" where consumers earn a dividend based on the purchases they make. And community-organising is in vogue in today's tech environment too, but it began outside web3 with fintech banks like <a href=""https://monzo.com/about/"">Monzo</a>, whose customers powered one of the most successful crowdfunds in history. Meanwhile, <a href=""https://wefunder.com/"" >Wefunder</a> lets anyone to invest in the companies they want to see succeed.  So we should take decentralisation seriously when it is applied in web3. <a href=""https://www.usebraintrust.com/about"">Braintrust</a> is building a user-owned talent network, where freelancers on the platform vote on major strategic decisions, whilst <a href=""https://hive.io"">Hive</a> is an excellent example of a decentralised blockchain, governed by the changes the community votes to approve. We saw the importance of that in action when Justin Sun, founder and CEO of Tron, a competitor, attempted a hostile takeover of its previous network, Steem, and Steemit, the social network launched alongside it, only for the community to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/hive-hard-fork-is-successful-steem-crashes-back-to-earth"" >fork the blockchain</a> instead and recreate themselves as Hive. Community-ownership is an established structure that is increasingly common today, and web3 organisations are using the same approach to fund, govern, and defend themselves onchain. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2000px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2000px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6333338b4290ecc92981d413_steem.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Steem was the target of a hostile takeover in March 2020. To defend themselves, the community replicated the social network under a new name, Hive. </figcaption></figure> Scaling for global usability  It's harder to argue against common wisdom when it's correct about the important facts. As the <a href=""https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/#:~:text=transactions%20are%20slower%20on%20web3%20because%20they're%20decentralized"" >Ethereum Foundation</a> puts it,""transactions are slower on web3 because they're decentralised."" The problem with interpreting that observation as a reason to ignore web3 completely is that it ignores how technology improves over time.  The infamous <a href=""https://smartup.life/web3-the-blockchain-trilemma-and-the-road-to-scale/"" >blockchain trilemma</a> implies that scaling applications require a sacrifice of either security or decentralisation. Instead, it's scalability that has been left in the dust, with the emphasis placed upon secure and decentralised applications that are open to anyone with an internet connection. However, today's challenges don't define tomorrow's achievements. If they did, we'd still be waiting to <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2022/09/12/1122375097/space-exploration-jfk-we-choose-the-moon-speech"" >choose the moon</a>.  We already see innovation happening to innovate away technical obstacles to mainstream adoption.  Early automobile manufacturers wanted to make better cars, and more of them. If they'd given up on the dream, we'd still be in the age of hand cranks. And we could all have any color we like""<a href=""http://oplaunch.com/blog/2015/04/30/the-truth-about-any-color-so-long-as-it-is-black/"" >as long as it's black</a>.""

Whilst web3 has a scalability problem today, that doesn't mean it will always have that problem.

We already see innovation happening to innovate away technical obstacles to mainstream adoption. Layer-0 solutions like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/cosmos"" >Cosmos</a> make it easy for anyone to launch their own blockchain with built-in interoperability, side-stepping the scalability limitations in existing congested blockchains. Meanwhile, the ecosystem is already spoilt for choice for roll-ups, a layer-2 solution to improve scalability built on top of secure and decentralised layer-1 blockchains (like Ethereum). The largest, like <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/arbitrum"" >Arbitrum</a>, reduce the cost of transacting onchain down to pennies, making web3 solutions an attractive innovation for major platforms like <a href=""https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/07/22/reddit-rolls-with-arbitrum-to-scale-its-ethereum-based-community-points-system/"" >Reddit</a>.

Growing beyond ponzi   Right from the <a href=""https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2013/04/bitcoin-is-a-ponzi-scheme-the-internet-currency-will-collapse.html#return"" >beginning</a>, bitcoin was called a Ponzi scheme. By association, every cryptocurrency since has attracted the label. It's only natural that web3 would too.   By definition, a Ponzi scheme is a type of fraud that involves an investment with a promise of high returns and low risk. It got its name from Charles Ponzi, who, in 1919, ran an investment scam involving <a href=""https://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=4294968365"" >postage stamps</a>. Ponzi used his success to lure others into an elaborate scheme with a promise of high returns but paid himself and earlier investors with the money he acquired from later investors.  To be sure, there have been ponzi schemes <a href=""https://time.com/3571415/bitcoin-ponzi-scheme-trendon-shavers-bitcoin-savings-and-trust/"">using bitcoin</a> and <a href=""https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/5-of-the-biggest-crypto-ponzi-schemes"" >other cryptocurrencies</a>. However, scams and illicit activities are often some of the first things to happen with new technologies, as was the case with <a href=""https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/weapons/a25414/tommy-gun-thompson-submachine/"" >Tommy guns</a>, which became iconic for their use by 1920s American gangsters before becoming a key asset for the Allies in World War II. Misuse by some doesn't make the underlying technology illegitimate.  The world's biggest and most respected businesses understand that web3, blockchain, and the metaverse have much to offer. If web3 is a ponzi scheme, <a href=""https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/26/microsoft-is-awarded-us-patent-for-crypto-token-creation-service/"" >Microsoft</a> is guilty, <a href=""https://thenextweb.com/news/nike-blockchain-sneakers-cryptokick-patent"" >Nike</a> is a crime boss, <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/ben-mayor-white"" >Adidas</a> is a scam, and <a href=""https://siliconangle.com/2019/10/17/sneakers-meet-blockchain-new-balance-pilot-shoe-authenticity/"" >New Balance</a> is pushing it too. Nobody really thinks these companies are scammers, however. No corporate executive who thought Web3 was a Ponzi scheme would be anywhere near it. As more household brands move into blockchain, the technology will quickly out grow its ponzi label. Scams will remain  "" they always do  "" but society will recognise that they must be mitigated, but tolerated, as blockchain technology becomes increasingly present in our lives.  Misuse by some doesn't make the underlying technology illegitimate.  The truth is some people just don't like web3, and it's okay not to like it, in the same way it's okay not to like Apple iPhones or apple crumble. Some people don't like banana shakes, but that doesn't mean banana shakes are deadly poison. Blockchain, the metaverse, and web3 are no different.  While there are legitimate criticisms of web3, not all criticisms are created equal. We can all agree that web3 is not perfect, but neither was web1, whilst web2 might never be. By contrast, web3 is just getting started; I'm optimistic about the future of the internet, and I think there are plenty of reasons to share in that optimism. ",4122
Gamechangers: how web3 is helping sports lovers engage with their teams and create their own,what web3 offers sports and innovators,Sat Jun 18 2022 22:06:38,NFTs offer a method for IP owners and creators to engage more deeply with their fans. Sport is no different. Randy Ginsburg Ginsburg explores how this $500 billion industry can use NFTs to drive engagement and create value for fans across the world and throughout the event lifecycle.,Mon Jun 20 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Builders,blockchain,Sport; Nft; Metaverse; Use-Cases,Randy Ginsburg," Since flirting with mainstream adoption in 2021, NFTs have demonstrated their ability to transform creative industries from music and art to publishing and fashion. By successfully bypassing traditional, entrenched industry gatekeepers, NFTs are putting more power and money into the hands of consumers and creators. Their impact on the sports industry will be no different.  While not obviously creative, sport is one of the purest forms of self-expression for both players and fans. Fandom runs deep and is highly emotional, creating a sense of loyalty and brand affinity that no other industry can match. Often passed down through generations, the fan-team (or fan-player) relationship is unbreakable and in many cases serves as an extension of one's identity. No one ever switched teams because their rival's shirt was on sale.  Meanwhile, the commercial implications are enormous. The global sports market is <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/03/10/2400658/28124/en/350-Billion-Worldwide-Sports-Industry-to-2031-Identify-Growth-Segments-for-Investment.html"" >worth over $500 billion,</a> with much of the leagues', teams', and players' value tied up in intellectual property. Leveraging this IP with web3 technologies like NFTs unlocks additional revenue streams for players, organisations, and major sports leagues around the globe. And thanks to the power of secondary royalty structures that can be irreversibly tied into smart contracts, these new revenue streams function in perpetuity. But more important than ROI, NFTs give the sports industry the opportunity to foster deeper fan relationships for the long term, letting fans get closer to the action and more connected to the game than ever before.  Today, web3 technologies are being adopted by the industry's biggest players to change sport as we know it, embracing new opportunities in ticketing, merchandise, fan communities, and longer-term fan relationships.  NFT Ticketing   The significance of NFTs for ticketing is made possible by the ability of blockchains to verify proof of unique ownership. Because of the blockchain's decentralised and distributed nature, no one individual can edit its records. This immutability makes it impossible for records to be faked and provides a timestamped ledger of ownership, tracking exactly who owns what and when it switches hands.  Major sports leagues like the <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2021/11/19/sports-tickets-nfts-digital-bobbleheads"">NFL</a> and <a href=""https://www.theticketingbusiness.com/2021/07/27/sacramento-kings-trials-nft-smart-ticket/"">NBA</a>, have begun experimenting with NFT ticketing to increase ticket value, drive attendance, and ultimately improve the fan experience. So far, NFT ticketing has taken two forms: digital tickets and ticket-dependent collectibles.  With digital tickets, fans receive an NFT ticket upon purchase that is minted on a blockchain. Last year, the NFL <a href=""https://www.ledgerinsights.com/nfl-launches-league-wide-nft-tickets-with-ticketmaster/"">announced</a> a partnership with Ticketmaster to mint tickets as NFTs, whilst blockchain ticketing platforms are also used by football teams like <a href=""https://www.ledgerinsights.com/english-football-team-adopts-blockchain-ticketing-with-secutix/"">West Bromwich Albion</a> in the UK and <a href=""https://www.ledgerinsights.com/ajax-football-blockchain-tickets-knvb/"">AFC Ajax</a>, the Netherlands' most successful club, as well as in the UK's largest cricket venues, like <a href=""https://www.ledgerinsights.com/blockchain-ticketing-sport-old-trafford-secutix/"">Old Trafford</a>, amongst many others. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:40%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""40%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ae486a690bcc6353e1185d_ivyYxpxjCh1igZkWaxRWamXQGZ3H6Tg62GM7A4mRBR5Fb9ujiqoKB7lPI_4KxejbQfOgms3Gj3l6y78cFsm6G6wR4Dm9HEkPaJtA%3Dw600.jpeg"" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto"" > <figcaption > MetaMavs Legend Brad Davis, by the Dallas Mavericks, one of the collectibles gifted to match-going fans. </figcaption></figure> Because these ticketing solutions can leverage smart contract technologies, sports organisations can use them more dynamically than existing solutions, such as influencing secondary markets to prevent ticket gouging. WBA used their tickets to mitigate Covid risks with tickets that only activated upon the self-certification of a negative test, whilst UEFA's blockchain-enabled tickets for <a href=""https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/mediaservices/news/025a-0f8e753e5b69-12cc5167a50a-1000--over-one-million-uefa-euro-2020-tickets-to-be-distributed-to-fa/"">Euro 2020</a> only activated when the holder was near the stadium, to prevent copying.  More experimentation has occurred around ticket-dependent assets, NFTs which are activated upon scanning tickets at the game. Once a ticket is scanned, fans receive a commemorative NFT which can serve as a digital proof of attendance token that can be used as an access token and a channel through which IP owners can create more value for their most committed fans. ""Let's say Luka [Doncic] has a 30 assist game,"" explains Mark Cuban, owner of Dallas Mavericks basketball team, in an <a href=""https://fortyeightminutes.com/exclusive-mark-cuban-talks-mavericks-more/"">interview with  Forty-Eight Minutes </a>.""There are going to be 500,000 people that say they were there, right? But the reality is, the people who are actually there are the ones who get the NFT commemorating that game.""  Ultimately, Cuban added, the whole idea is to reward the fans for coming.""You can't just buy a ticket and not go. What gets you the NFT is that you actually scan your ticket. And if you go to 10 games ... there will be rewards for that,"" he said. The Mavericks have experimented with both options, recently gifting fans with <a href=""https://www.mavscollectibles.com/"">pixelated avatars</a>, called MetaMav Legends, once their home-game tickets were scanned.  Merchandise and collectibles   NFT trading cards are responsible for the largest example of mainstream adoption of web3 technologies in sport, and one of the best web3 product experiences to date. A brainchild of Dapper Labs, <a href=""http://nbatopshot.com"" >NBA Top Shot</a> is a blockchain-based trading card platform built in partnership with the NBA. Top Shot allows users to collect, buy, sell, and trade NFTs of NBA highlights, called Moments. Similar to traditional sports cards, Moments vary in rarity and can be purchased individually or in packs.  Top Shot quickly became a global phenomenon after launching in October 2020, reaching $45 million in trading volume in a single day at its peak. A poorly executed flood of supply rocked the market last year, but the market should be seen as a major success of web3 technologies, and a breakout use case. The market has recently crossed $1 billion in total sales and forged a <a href=""https://magic.nbatopshot.com/#:~:text=Game%206%2C%201980%20NBA%20Finals&text=The%20signature%20performance%20from%20Magic's,only%2080%20will%20ever%20exist."">historical partnership</a> with Magic Johnson.  For Johnson, it was Dapper Labs' innovation and the opportunity for players to profit off their on-court greatness that led him to partner with Top Shot.  ""They're really finding another revenue stream for these players, with their image, likeness, and plays, (so) that they can make money. That's what I really love too  it's not just for myself, but for all, whether that's current or retired guys; they're able to make some money off of the plays and different pictures that they created in their NBA careers,"" he said in an interview with   <a href=""https://theathletic.com/3315531/2022/05/23/magic-johnson-top-shot-nba/""> The Athletic </a> .    With these learnings in hand, Dapper has inked deals with the NFL and UFC to bring these leagues to the forefront of digital collectibles and is working with the Spanish football team Real Madrid  "" current European champions  "" to""create a whole new experience layer for fans,"" according to Michael Sutherland, the club's Chief Transformation Officer.""Real Madrid is giving our fans the opportunity to invest in themselves, collect exclusive digital items, and own a piece of the online world,"" <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/real-madrid-and-lava-deliver-first-ever-smart-ticket-nft-experiences-on-flow-that-transform-fan-engagement-for-real-madrid-s-600-million-global-fans-831178554.html"">adding</a>,""it's fundamentally game-changing for the fan experience.""

""It's fundamentally game-changing for the fan experience.""    Michael Sutherland, Chief Transformation Officer at Real Madrid FC, Europe's most successful football club   Looking to the future, digital wearables are likely to resemble a large opportunity for sports teams. A concept already validated beyond the sports industry by the likes of Epic Games, who sold 3.3 million wearable units in their game Fortnite, grossing over <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/05/11/epic-reveals-it-made-50-million-from-one-set-of-fortnite-skins/?sh=3ce91c993903"">$50 million</a>. Nascent companies like <a href=""https://fancurve.com/"" >Fancurve</a> are currently racing to define the sector in around digital sports apparel and lifestyle collectibles. As we begin to spend more time in virtual environments, the same way that fans love to rock their gear in real life should be expected to cross over to the digital world, as a way to feel involved in communities they care about and illustrate their allegiance.  Web3 ownership clubs   Much of the beauty of sports lies in its ability to bring people together. And while the internet already made it possible to connect with fans all over the world, decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) are taking sports-based communities and fan clubs to new level of engagement. By making it easy for people with a shared vision to <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/how-daos-are-creating-a-new-model-of-work"">pool their resources</a>, many DAOs have been created to change the way that the traditionally gate-kept sports industry functions.  We are already seeing DAOs take shape as modern-day fan clubs, but instead of fans watching from the sidelines, DAO members want a seat at the table. <a href=""https://www.krausehouse.club/"">Krause House</a> is a leading example. Sitting broadly at the intersection of sports and Web3, Krause House is a DAO on a mission to own an NBA team. With a community of 5,000 members, ranging from high-ranking tech executives to former agents, owners, and players, Krause House has already made its presence felt in basketball circles. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1500px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1500px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/634543fc72214abba1051d71_kh.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Krause House is an example of the extent to which fans are keen to engage in the sports that they love. </figcaption></figure> Most recently claiming a <a href=""https://big3.com/news/decentralized-autonomous-organization-krause-house-to-purchase-fire-tier-ownership-nft-allotment-for-ball-hogs-big3-team/"" >partial stake in the BIG3 Ball Hogs team</a>, the DAOs assets include a sports and crypto accelerator, a venture capital fund, and sports media arms. To fund these various operations, the Krause House turned to NFTs. Through the primary sale of 2,050 NFTs, each with various degrees of scarcity and holder perks, the DAO raised a 1000 ETH war chest to tackle its biggest ambitions (around $4 million at the time of mint).  <a href=""https://linksdao.io/"" >LinksDAO</a> is built on the same idea, built on and united by the mission to buy a Top 100-calibre golf course and transform it into a modern-day country club. To fund this goal, LinksDAO sold 9,090 memberships, raising over $10 million dollars. In addition to the governance rights in the DAO that give holders the right to vote on decisions and rule changes, LinksDAO NFT holders will receive membership rights to the first LinksDAO course, discounts with partners like Five Iron Golf and Ship Sticks, and access to member-exclusive events in real life and online.  Deeper fan relationships  Similar to that of DAOs, many sports leagues are using NFTs as access tokens for unique IRL and digital fan experiences. The most innovative in the space is <a href=""https://www.fcf.io/"" >Fan Controlled Football</a>, the world's first professional sports league controlled by fans.

Each team-specific collection consists of 8,888 NFTs, serving as governance tokens that allow owners to vote on bigger team decisions, like their name, logo, and even who to draft. Ballerz Collective NFT holders will also gain access to future league initiatives like collectible digital wearables and a play-to-earn mobile game.  American football legend Tiki Barber explains just how game-changing this is.""As the league grows and the number of participants increases, having these early tokens gives fans power  from team management decisions to priority in-game mechanics. Where else can a fan have that kind of influence and impact?,"" he asked <a href=""https://decrypt.co/96706/why-fan-controlled-football-embraced-ethereum-nfts-for-its-interactive-league"" > Decrypt </a>.  Web3's integration into sports is still early, but the excitement around its potential is palpable and justified. Between the new revenue streams, use cases, and intimate fan engagement, NFTs and web3 are gamechangers for the sports industry, and the game is only just kicking off. ",4343
Why Arbitrum is one of Ethereum's most important scaling solutions,why arbitrum is one of ethereums most important scaling solutions,Fri Sep 16 2022 21:03:46,"Arbitrum is the largest layer-2 on Ethereum with applications ranging from helping manage millions of dollars in decentralised finance to connecting some of the most vibrant communities on Reddit.

But all that growth has put too much pressure on the network, pushing gas prices (network transaction costs) to sky-high levels. $50 in transaction fees only to buy an NFT?! Such was the norm at the peak of the market, and it's likely to happen again if the markets heat up.  Ultimately, Ethereum's scalability problem has become too apparent.  In response to the scalability problem, a series of solutions have sprung up. Arbitrum is one of those  "" it is an Ethereum layer-2, an umbrella term that describes chains built on top of the Ethereum mainnet (layer-1) to help it scale. Developed by <a href=""https://offchainlabs.com"" >Offchain Labs</a>, Arbitrum is one of the largest Ethereum L2s, with a around <a href=""https://defillama.com/chains/Rollup"">$950 million</a> locked into its smart contracts and 116 protocols, at time of publication. Optimism, another layer-2, is narrowly behind, with $850 million locked into 72 protocols.  The appeal is obvious. Interacting with dApps on Arbitrum can be up to <a href=""https://l2fees.info/"">20 times cheaper</a> than on Ethereum. <a href=""https://curve.fi/"" >Curve</a>, a decentralised currency exchange popular on Ethereum, is one of the many organisations to have expanded to Arbitrum.""I think the main thing is that cheaper gas on layer-2s allows for more computationally advanced smart contracts at affordable gas prices,"" Curve's pool optimisation researcher, who goes by the pseudonym <a href=""https://twitter.com/nagakingg"">nagaking</a>, tells Culture3.  Cheaper gas allows protocols to build dApps without prohibitive costs to users, nagaking explained, adding,""you can see that Curve v2, which uses more complex computations than other exchanges, has gained <a href=""https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/uniswap-vs-curve-which-is-the-best-dex/"" >more market share on Arbitrum</a> than on Ethereum,"" because these complex computations are cheaper to run and are thus relatively more attractive for users.

Layer-2s aren't the only solution around. Alternative layer 1s  "" widely known as Ethereum killers  "" such as Avalanche, Fantom, and Solana offered an additional alternative to those seeking a more efficient experience on web3. Some, like Avalanche and Fantom, are highly compatible with Ethereum because they rely on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (which processes the smart contracts on the chains), they are still separate blockchains with their own technology to secure the data they store.  A simplification is to think of a blockchain as a stack of three different layers: an application layer to process smart contracts, a consensus layer to secure the data, and a network layer to communicate between them. Alternative L1s use different consensus and network layers, whilst L2s just use a different network layer, relying on Ethereum for their security consensus protocols. Let's unpack that a little bit.  How Arbitrum works  From a user perspective, Arbitrum feels like the Ethereum mainnet. You get on the network with your MetaMask, view the chain history on <a href=""https://arbiscan.io"" >Arbiscan</a> (an Etherscan clone), spend Ether as your currency, and interact with dApps just as you would on the Ethereum mainnet.  Behind the scenes, however, things operate a little bit differently. To help users understand, the Arbitrum team has provided this exquisite drawing on their developer documentation to break it all down. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6324e25e6c24781fd0d4d2a8_O8brvvJtDMkwPNi9vi6l5-EwPXLr8lbOgRFfZCsB5i-vGEnx0_SVkr8uMCtAIx5mYUk6FPu59wvjzYW8x46H6UDNZ12VYfWQbyajptyxow6h7pn3JGB-qbcxYRP-rMVQHUU1DzfYSx9LiNRuP9tSUi52agANlafhF0g7zlrAjwCa-KIQBQ-JTh_C2Q.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption ><a href=""https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/Inside_Arbitrum""> Arbitrum provide </a>  the visual explanation of how their technology works. </figcaption></figure> When you buy an NFT on Arbitrum or swap a token, that transaction request goes into Arbitrum's 'inbox', which the chain processes, generating a transaction receipt. The receipt has several outputs, like the data about the transaction and the actual instruction it contains.  Arbitrum is powered by a technology called rollups, which bundle (or, well, roll up) the data of hundreds of transactions, like NFT mints or token swaps, into a single transaction on the Ethereum mainnet. With so many transactions are rolled up into a single transaction, the transaction gas fee is split between more people, making it cheaper for everyone.  It's like taking a road trip in a shared vehicle, rather than driving separately, and you can use a side road to avoid the traffic on the main road (or main-net), whilst still benefiting from its infrastructure (like the signs).  Arbitrum in evolution  In late June 2022, Arbitrum was meant to launch a programme called <a href=""https://medium.com/offchainlabs/the-arbitrum-odyssey-87d6e11171d5"" >Odyssey</a>, which would give those who use the network free NFTs from crypto native artists <a href=""https://twitter.com/ratwell0x"" >Ratwell</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/sugoiNFT"" >Sugoi</a>. That had to be put on hold after enormous pressure on the network which saw gas fees on Arbitrum jump well above those on Ethereum. ""Because of the heavy load being put on the chain causing higher than normal gas fees, we've decided it is best to pause the Odyssey until Nitro is released so that all communities and projects within Arbitrum continue to have a friction-free experience,"" <a href=""https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1542159109511847937"" >tweeted</a> the Arbitrum team at the time.  That upgrade, Nitro, finally came to the chain in late August. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6324e260cfb2c7958003862c_VCUp0NcC_lgcLYqY4WDIksRPzIvjtk5pxDALeTTHgSiWbdhUmezePPGf0p9ktyFDe4VNziOg1Dey7l4hZiNUBzO32gQC7XMGy1lcClFUl_59k5YGV6saUm9aCgMHLnlLnn6Ndg3_nJTgSj7QACmKmLAJsupbGWkOf3fPsDU2tL-uZje9KNZ8mcsAsg.png""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> </figure> Nitro further compresses data sent to the Ethereum mainnet, reducing network fees and accelerating transactions. The charts tell an impressive story: the upgraded infrastructure has led to a sharp uptick in transactions on the layer-2.  Builders are taking notice of the changes. Josh Baker is the CEO of <a href=""https://damm.finance"" >dAMM</a>, a lending platform planning to expand to Arbitrum soon.&nbsp; ""Arbitrum seems to be taking a major step forward by creating further scaling improvements,"" he says, predicting that""either one layer-2 scales substantially enough to win the entirety of the layer-2 market, or we could see a distributed app-chain future if that isn't completed fast enough.""  Arbitrum Nova, on to new ground  Arbitrum is not just built for decentralised finance. In early August, the Arbitrum team released Nova, a new Arbitrum chain optimised for social media and gaming dApps. Nova is faster than the original, unoptimised blockchain, giving it the capabilities to accommodate data-heavy apps. It achieves this through a centralising decision built on <a href=""https://blog.infura.io/post/consensys-infrastructure-product-infura-joins-the-data-availability-committee-for-arbitrum-nova-offchain-labs-new-network?hss_channel=tw-3129477561"" >Data Availability Certificates</a>.  Blockchains are about verification and trust, and Nova's design relies on a system of minimal but efficient trust. Nova relies on a technical committee that stamps these certificates, centralising the role of validating transaction data to the seven committee members: Offchain Labs, Reddit, Google Cloud, FTX (a crypto exchange), P2P (a staking provider), and QuickNode and Infura (both blockchain infrastructure platforms).  So far, the most high-profile use of the chain comes from Reddit, which could potentially bring millions of its users to the chain through its rewards programme Community Points. Essentially in-app tokens, Community Points are currently in use on two subreddits, Reddit's term for community forums: r/CryptoCurrency and r/FortNiteBR. These subreddits offer Community Points called <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/wk75p2/pack_your_moons_were_moving_to_mainnet/"" >Moons</a> and <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/wk76yt/pack_your_bricks_were_moving_to_mainnet/"" >Bricks</a>, respectively.  These tokens are stored in a user wallet independent of the company or moderators, and can be used within the subreddit to tip other contributors, vote on governance decisions, and purchase custom perks, but can also be used beyond the Reddit ecosystem: any developer can build an application that allows Redditors to use their tokens.  It should be noted that Reddit's search for a technical solution to deploy its Community Points was quite a fanfare, and possibly one of the interesting examples of building in public',&nbsp;testament to the community involvement that has made Reddit one of the internet's most popular websites  "" and at the same time embodys much of the ethos behind web3.  The platform ran a ""The Great Reddit Scaling Bake-Off"" competition <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/hbjx25/the_great_reddit_scaling_bakeoff/"" >two years ago</a>, receiving submissions from many upstart chains. The infrastructure was originally built in 2021 on an Ethereum test network, not directly connected to the mainnet, and was migrated to Arbitrum after the scaling solution was chosen as the winner in <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/opi5rg/scaling_reddits_community_points_with_arbitrum/"">May 2022</a>. Community Points recently moved over to the Ethereum mainnet, integrating the tokens with the wider web3 ecosystem. Partnered with FTX, gas fees are around ¬£0.01, though on the Fortnite forum they are paid by Reddit.  The L2 is seeing increasing adoption within the web3 community as well, with OpenSea announcing that it will <a href=""https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1572250900198203392"">support Arbitrum NFTs</a> from tomorrow, on September 21st. Despite the decentralised promise of web3, almost all NFTs, on Ethereum and beyond, are sold on OpenSea, which currently only supports Ethereum and Solana.  Volumes on Arbitrum's largest NFT platform, Stratos, are miniscule, by contrast, with each of the <a href=""https://opensea.io/rankings?sortBy=total_volume"">top thousand collections</a> on OpenSea by volume exceeding the <a href=""https://stratosnft.io/stats"">largest</a> on Stratos by at least a factor of ten, so the move will see large volumes of Ether moved onto Arbitrum. Meanwhile, artists on Ethereum will now be able to sell NFTs via Arbitrum and pay lower gas fees, whilst remaining on the world's biggest NFT market (OpenSea) and blockchain (Ethereum).  Unlike Optimism, the biggest layer-2 chain, Arbitrum has not yet released a token despite much speculation.""If there is a token, I hope that it will have a strong utility while aligning long-term participants in the ecosystem,"" GMX core contributor X said. Optimism airdropped the first batch of tokens in June to existing users. The L2's eligibility criteria included repeat use of Optimism, voting in DAO, multi-sig signature, and Gitcoin donations to Optimism.  Arbitrum airdrop may include some, none, or all of these criteria  "" the reason for opaqueness is to prevent gaming the system, known as airdrop farming. But if you genuinely participate in the network, trying out dApps and use cases like Reddit, you may be rewarded for being an early user  the classic web3 experience. ",3976

In South Africa, a wine once coveted by Napoleon found new prominence while being <a href=""https://www.howwemadeitinafrica.com/africas-first-fine-wine-nft-auction-explained/142499/"">sold as an NFT</a>, giving wine connoisseurs a newfound ability to track key details regarding its vintage. Meanwhile, a Pakistani-led team is using its <a href=""https://www.womenrise.art"" >Women Rise</a> NFT collection to unite women's rights activists and visual artists across the globe.  All around the world, organisations are leveraging NFTs to bring people together around shared purposes and interests. As charities work to build support around their own social missions, they too are beginning to utilise blockchain in surprising and novel ways. In particular, web3 partners are helping non-profits stand out in a crowded marketplace, bring new demographics of donors into their ecosystems, and encourage sustainable community building amongst their donors and other key stakeholders.   ""NFTs can help extend their support.""    Jane Curtis   Today's philanthropy landscape is crowded. Even as social media has given non-profits access to a nearly unlimited audience of donors, it has also created intense competition for attention with other charities worldwide. Standing out remains critical for any charity hoping to make its mark, but the stakes are far higher. Those that can utilise NFTs, both as a cultural signifier and as a way to raise funds, have a major advantage. ""Charities really struggle with retaining their supporters,"" says Jane Curtis, a fundraising and leadership consultant with decades of experience in the non-profit sector.""NFTs can help extend their support.""  Consider Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home (EDCH), an animal welfare organisation based in Scotland. In 2022, the non-profit partnered with the Moon Cats Rescue web3 community, running an NFT fundraising auction that raised ¬£87,000 to support key initiatives. The fundraiser was a major success, in part because it was able to leverage the charity's non-profit experience with the web3 project's blockchain expertise. <figure class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1600px""><div><img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/640b55242e2b16681c078d8b_WhatsApp%20Image%202023-03-10%20at%2016.04.29%20(1).jpeg"" loading=""lazy""> <figcaption><em>Edinburgh Dog and Cat Home has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds from web3 communities aligned with their mission to support dogs and cats. </figcaption></figure>""The best partnerships are where the project can help you navigate the crypto world and where you can help them create a better society,"" says David Mitchell, EDCH's Digital Fundraising Manager.""A huge, overwhelming portion of our success comes from the crypto projects we have worked with. Partnership is everything.""  Implementing NFTs into a non-profit's operation won't just help it to stand out  it also gives it access to an entirely new generation of givers. In fact, <a href=""https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/content/dam/fc-public/docs/resources/2021-future-of-philanthropy-summary.pdf"" >Fidelity Charitable</a> report that American millennials give more than double to charity, compared with older generations. That is, in part, due to how each generation sees its role in society: in the USA, 74% of millennials identify as philanthropists, compared to just 48% of Generation X and 35% of Baby Boomers. The trend is reflected on both sides of the Atlantic: 81% of British millennials and younger generations donated to charity in 2021, while only 62% of those aged 40 and above did the same.  Save the Children has effectively used NFT fundraisers and cryptocurrency donations to unlock new supporters since they began accepting Bitcoin in 2013.""The audience is totally different from our core donor base: it is skewed male, and it's younger,"" says Linda McBain, Chief Digital Officer at the children's charity's UK arm, noting that Save the Children teams from Italy to India have been actively exploring the opportunity.  In doing so, Linda explains how the charity has been able to access donors in locations that previously were not focused upon.""We are also seeing donations coming from countries where we don't have such a significant brand presence, but where donors may have found us through our engagement with web3 communities.""  When non-profits reach out to web3 communities, they aren't just unlocking a new cohort of potential donors and patrons  they are also introducing themselves to organisations that are particularly interested in building around a shared purpose, a demographic that naturally encourages sustainable community building. ""People buy NFTs as a mechanism for them to express what they believe in, what is an extension of them, and what they want the world to know about them,"" as Sanchan Saxena, the Vice President of Products at Coinbase, noted in an <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/coinbase-nfts-product-vp-on-taking-nfts-mainstream/id1561616636?i=1000547892452"" >interview</a> with NFT Now.""NFTs can reflect you being a part of that community."" If charities can incorporate NFTs with a clear understanding of their potential, they stand to gain a more loyal giving base.  That potential is of key interest to Inna Modja, a UN Climate Ambassador and Head of Philanthropy at World of Women, whose members have collaboratively donated over $1 million to charities supporting women's rights initiatives.""We want to create a bridge between digital communities and communities in real life, fighting for things that are really important."" ""We've been able to do more with digital communities than in real life, and faster,"" she <a href=""https://www.culture3.xyz/posts/inna-modja"" >tells</a> Culture3, noting that she has seen the very act of purchasing an NFT change people's behaviour in not just their digital life, but their real life as well  in one case, leading a peer to start recycling more after joining a climate focused NFT project.   ""We want to create a bridge between digital communities and communities in real life.""    UN Climate Ambassador and Head of Philanthropy at World of Women   One of the most inspiring examples of web3 activism comes from Geena Dunne, the founder of Honey Badges, a community-led funding initiative. With a community of 880 people, Honey Badges gives every NFT holder a say in its structure and operations. Every three months, members elect a 10-person committee to vet grant applications, who then curate their decisions with the rest of the community.  Honey Badges has been able to organically create a community of donors who vote together on how funds are allocated, and then work together to make sure those projects are a success. And in some cases, recipients of the community's awards  which have helped fund an arts centre for refugees in Uganda and an indigenous academy in Australia, among other things  have remained active in the community's conversations long after, through their NFTs.  That connection, through their shared NFTs, has allowed community members to later draw on the expertise of a truly distributed operation.""You are being brought into a global community,"" Geena notes.""It's a level of support and practical access to skills and volunteers that you wouldn't otherwise know existed."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:828px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""828px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63867296da0c3f13a06c7e8a_1_kWbgx4jxvr2Text04srUIA.gif"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > The members of World of Women have collaboratively donated over $1 million to charities supporting women's rights initiatives. </figcaption></figure> The potential for NFTs and charities to partner hand in hand will only increase with time. Consider current charity auctions, which sell valuable items to donors for a one-time cost. If those same items were sold as NFTs, they could be encoded with smart contracts that automatically transfer a portion of the item, when resolve, to the charity, like a royalty.   ""You are being brought into a global community.""    Geena Dune, founder, Honey Badges   As the NFT, perhaps a cherished memento, a historic item, or signed sporting memorabilia,&nbsp;changes hands, it not only generates more funds for the charity, but also raises awareness for the cause itself.  Integrating NFTs into a charity's fundraising strategy is no easy process, both in terms of the strategy required and the technical expertise to execute it. But the charities which are first to do so will benefit most from tapping into the web3 opportunity.

Why Justin Waldron thinks storytelling NFTs are the next big thing in web3,why justin waldron thinks storytelling nfts are the next big thing in web3,Thu Jan 26 2023 11:28:51,"As co-founder of Zynga, Justin Waldron helped create the $20bn social gaming sector. Now he wants to do the same in web3, and define storytelling as a new category in NFTs. He speaks to Leo Nasskau about building a genre-defining business, advice for young entrepreneurs, and his plan for Storyverse. Clovis McEvoy brings the conversation to life.",Thu Jan 26 2023 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,storytelling,Communities; Storytelling-Nfts; Bayc,Clovis McEvoy,"  If there's one thread that runs through Justin Waldron's career, it's people. Bringing groups together and giving them a space to play has been his lifelong passion and, as luck might have it, he's exceptionally good at it.  Of course, he didn't know that back in 2007, when he dropped out of the University of Connecticut to co-found Zynga, the gaming giant that all but invented the social gaming genre. Aged 19 at the time, he built the company's first game, Zynga Poker, and stayed with the company until 2013. By that point, Zynga Poker had quickly grown to 38 million daily players; other hits included FarmVille and Words with Friends. Zynga the company, meanwhile, had since debuted on the stock market at a $10 billion valuation in 2011.  Moving onto new projects, Waldron went on to advise and invest in a range of startups, including Substack, Kik, and Decentraland, working with the latter since the last crypto winter in 2018. Soon later, Waldron was back in the ring himself. After nonchalantly raising another $100m for his next gaming company Playco in 2020, he is now leading their mission to define the next category of NFTs in web3: stories.   ""Storyverse is ArtBlocks for stories.""    Justin Waldron  ""Writers haven't been able to participate in the web3 boom as artists have,"" Waldon begins.""How do you help them be part of building the culture of web3? How do you help them to create fun, shared experiences?"" He draws a comparison with ArtBlocks, the platform that gave generative artists the tools to turn their niche into a fully-fledged artistic category.""ArtBlocks solved the problem of putting generative art on the blockchain in a way that was fun and interesting. How do we do that for stories. Storyverse is ArtBlocks for stories."" ""That's the problem we set out to solve for storytellers,"" Waldron explains. Storyverse is his solution: a storytelling platform that empowers writers to produce, publish, and monetise short-form animated stories, using the IP of top-tier NFT collections, like the Bored Ape Yacht Club.""We're letting IP holders allow creators to make successful collections, use this IP, and actually create a business together,"" he explains.""It is something that people have been talking about for over a year in NFT communities: how we go about using the IP rights. This is the solution that people have wanted for a long time."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1280px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1280px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/63d2833b3ee6d8a75b4b4a09_0*hARSW9EM7Ckq9ISb.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > Storyverse empowers authors to create collectible stories, inspired by existing web3 IP. </figcaption></figure> Not only can storytellers write and animate the adventures of the characters (each licensed by their owners), but Waldron has also drawn upon his extensive gaming background to emphasise choice-driven game mechanics on the platform, letting writers engage their community in an ever-evolving choose your own adventure' style narrative. ""We thought, what if we made story collections where all the people who mint get the same first minute, but at the end of that first minute there's a choice: take the red pill or the blue pill?' The choice that users make becomes a permanent trait of their NFT. While everyone starts off at the same point, each choice makes a person's story NFT increasingly unique.""   ""This is the solution that people have wanted for a long time.""    Justin Waldron   Drawing lessons from the previous era of collectible stories, comic books, Waldron plans to build a thriving marketplace for collectible stories in web3.""Writers as a creative class are so important to the broader culture,"" he emphasises.""People want to collect stories. We know this; comic books have been collected for decades. Authors could have an even bigger opportunity than artists, in terms of scale, but with current platforms they're put in a situation where it's hard for them to stand out in this mostly visual world."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""padding-bottom:56.33802816901409%"" data-rt-type=""video"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width="""" data-rt-max-height=""56.33802816901409%"" data-rt-dimensions=""426:240"" data-page-url=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/790937705?color=2B30F5&muted=1&loop=1""> <iframe allowfullscreen=""true"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/790937705"" title=""Character Pass Video""></iframe> </figure> Making stories competitive in the web3 marketplace is exactly the kind of design challenge that Waldron thrives on. There is no tried and true' solution. It's a technological and social landscape that he says has significant parallels to the early days of social media, where solving new and unique problems was the name of the game  literally. ""It was a real innovation when companies like Facebook started offering APIs,"" Waldron reflects, noting that Zynga was built on the back of Facebook's social network.""You can't overstate how important it is when somebody comes out with a new platform that allows businesses to build on top of it. That's at the core of Ethereum  but it's also so much more, making everything interoperable by default and permissionless. Everyone is free to collaborate with any other project. It's a foundational platform layer that's going to enable so many different types of businesses over the next decade. Storyverse is something that you couldn't do without blockchain.""  New platforms is not the only similarity Waldron perceives between the early days of Zynga and the early days of web3: what it takes to succeed is similar too. He argues that the fundamental originality of web3's paradigms favour the same humble, beginner's mindset that he initially relied on at Zynga.""We lacked experience, and we didn't know what we didn't know,"" he recalls. ""That meant we made some very dumb mistakes, but it also meant that we invented things from scratch, we reinvented business models, and we didn't take anything for granted. When something is as different as web3, you have to approach it in the same way: experience is incredibly useful, but a huge amount of the space is a new problem to solve.""  The biggest lesson Waldron learnt from his formative years at Zynga can be summarised in one word: focus.""You have to know what you want to make,"" he says. Whenever that north star was forgotten, Waldron explains,""we started losing sight of the customers, or we were trying to serve somebody else."" He recalls the pressure that came with becoming a public company, with myriad investors watching your decisions every quarter.  At the time, Zynga ran the world's largest free poker website, and pressure was piling on from investors to monetise the opportunity and pivot to real money poker online, which was being legalised across Europe and the United States at the time. ""But the truth is that real money gaming is such a different business than free and premium games,"" Waldron says. When they tried to make the switch, it didn't go smoothly.""It's a great lesson in how similar things can look different and how something logical can be wrong at the same time. There weren't people in the company who were even excited about doing that (real money gaming). We gave it the best shot, but I think it was just doomed from the start. It was a decision where we started following what common sense Wall Street logic would tell us. It wasn't an initiative that we birthed within the company. That's not a good way to go.""  Now, after a year spent focusing on what Waldron describes as""the hard infrastructure and architecture problems,"" the Storyverse team are ready to roll out their first collections. At first, only Bored Ape holders will be able to license their characters to writers on Storyverse, and only the first 3,000 to sign up (from January 27th), but Waldron is optimistic about how the next few months will pan out.""I'm super stoked to get our first collections out,"" he says.""I think when people see for the first time that there's a story being told with all these different apes, that it features the IP they already care about, that they already love, and that they already want to support, it will be a huge step forward for the space.""   ""We want to show them that collectible stories are the next wave.""    Justin Waldron   While Storyverse's tools are open for anyone to experiment with, the company's initial drops will focus on high-quality, curated content.""Delivering on quality probably means curating a lot of the collections that go out over the next few months. I think we'll revisit that approach, but for now we're working with people who we think are going to make great content, who can push the platform forward, and who can get everyone excited about story collections.""  At its heart, Storyverse is trying to do something foundational: inspire a brand-new category of NFTs. No small challenge, but, if past is prologue, then it's one that Waldron is uniquely suited to achieve.""This will be the year that writers have their moment,"" he predicts.""We have to go out there and show the value of this to everybody in the ecosystem. We want to show them that collectible stories are the next wave."" ",2691

And Wise Sigma Toad had a lot of rabbit holes to explore. A community-minded""art spectator,"" she quickly became enthralled by the web3 space upon discovering NFTs for the first time during the pandemic. She ventured to MakersPlace, the curated art platform, and then to OpenSea and Tezos, bouncing from one marketplace to another in search of art.  Wise prefers to be known as a""spectator"" rather than a collector, building a name for herself as a web3 commentator and a Community Manager for Objkt, Tezos's largest art platform. She says it is the perfect job for someone who is""drawn to art that is visually captivating and speaks to you in a spiritual sense."" Her primary focus is on hosting artist spaces on Twitter and helping artists develop their narrative and establish themselves as a brand, though she contributes across the Objkt ecosystem, from bug reports to the Discord server. ""I'm part of the web3 building blocks,"" she explains, performing a role where the responsibilities change every day. It's an attitude and a situation that all successful names in web3 can relate too, each building their own communities and projects.""I'm just a tiny little cog in the machine, keeping it moving. I don't see myself as a personality in Tezos. What I'm doing is more important than my name and identity.""   ""I don't consider myself to be a collector  "" I acquire art. I am an art spectator.""    Wise  ""I'm just trying to help people, in a small or big way. I want to make the space easier for people to come in and have them enjoy their experience."" As quickly as the web3 space is evolving and as important growth is, Wise places her emphasis on art education and security, and she is also keen to see web3 communities become more open to other art genres such as hip hop music and dance, amongst others.   One collection she has enjoyed watching develop comes from the Operator art house and Anika Meier, titled  Unsigned . A collection of signatures from 100 women and non-binary artists, it is a critical commentary on an established fact, that art which is not signed by men consistently sells for less and is exhibited less frequently. Per the artists,  Unsigned   ""reverses the negative value the signatures currently hold through their transformation into art."" Wise hopes the collection acts as a starting point for an important conversation in art communities on Tezos and web3 more broadly, to ensure that the aged legacies of the traditional art world do not rear their heads in NFTs. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:2500px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""2500px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/631b6ed25bd59b5a6e8320fc_artifact.png"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Dejha Ti's signature, of the  <a href=""https://objkt.com/collection/KT1Hm9Ybeti27gPQMCbAGYAskymnbYcuuqHD""> Unsigned </a>  collection, by  <a href=""https://twitter.com/operator_______""> Operator </a> . </figcaption></figure> When Wise first started acquiring NFTs, she gravitated towards visual elements that were photo and paint heavy  until coming across <a href=""https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/501072""> 0119AI </a>, an AI-augmented piece by Jenni Pasanen. Assisted by a type of neural network called a generative adversarial network, it prompted Wise to explore other interests.""<em>0119AI  really changed the conversation for me about what artwork can be. I get the same feeling looking at this piece as I do a real photograph."" Subsequently, Wise has developed an interest in others forms of experimental photography, a style she finds rebellious and values for its frequent focus on imperfections.""Experimental photography says that we're not perfect, we're human beings, and that's natural.

Beyond creating their art, artists are responsible for marketing themselves on social media, particularly Spaces, maintaining relationships with collectors, and managing their presence on marketplace platforms.   ""AR art is changing the narrative.""    Wise   Wise helps guide artists through learning these new skills and acts as a point of contact for artists attempting to navigate the intricate world of web3.

Closely exposed to art and every step of the artist's journey countless times a day, Wise is closely integrated into the space. Every day she rotates her screensaver on her Mac and phone to a different collected NFT.  As for what's next in the web3 and NFT space, Wise believes that collaborations are booming.""Collaboration is becoming more of a sub-genre, where two or more artists are coming together and fusing their styles to create something new.

"You'll need art on those walls  "" what does your metaverse look like?",youll need art on those walls,Tue Aug 23 2022 10:59:37,"Web2 platforms typically degrade into status games where we're all competing for an algorithm's attention. Charlotte Eytan argues that web3 enables a more balanced and accessible environment for art curation, creating an ecosystem where conventionally distinct terms like collecting, curating, and even creating become almost indistinguishable. But this should not stop us recognising the value that curators, with expertise, lived experience, and a trained eye, can bring to the space.",Tue Aug 23 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Artistry,art,Opinion,Charlotte-eytan," The term work-life balance' has always been a dangerous misnomer. Why should work be such a taxing idea that we completely detach it from our lives? Over the past couple of decades, tech startups and increasingly many others have begun to recast that traditional dichotomy, normalising higher expectations by providing souped-up workplaces with gourmet kitchens, ping pong tables, and other amenities all to promote a richer work-life.  Largely due to Covid, employees from all sectors have now been afforded the same agency and freedom previously reserved for in-demand employees, like software engineers and senior executives. It is not surprising, then, that the startups which have emerged as tech leaders create products that champion more autonomous ideals. Take platforms like Instagram which democratise curatorship; suddenly, we are all photographers and tastemakers and trendsetters  or least we can be, if we play by their rules.  Web2 platforms tend to operate as zero-sum status games where we are all competing for an algorithm's attention, and some go to extreme lengths to win, from creating bots and rent-seeking tools to spending hours optimising content for a platform we ultimately have no ownership in. Simply put, equal access does not mean equal return.  By marrying democratised access with financial incentives and ownership, web3 makes a more balanced environment for art curation possible. Now, when a curator discovers an emerging artist and invests in their work, they have a stake in the artist's success. You can buy upside so that not only is the curator incentivised by the tastemaker' status that comes with discovering the next Basquiat, the graffiti artist who rose to prominence in the 1980s, but through the aligned financial upside that comes from their success. When they win, you win.  Curation in web3 has consequently been more about empowering collectors and artists in the NFT space to be curators themselves. In a sense, conventionally separate identities like curator, advisor, and collector become almost indistinguishable. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:4160px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""4160px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6304b6eca2dedc5800f4ea2b_basqia.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Two people observing  <a href=""https://www.thebroad.org/art/jean-michel-basquiat/obnoxious-liberals"" > Obnoxious Liberals </a> , by Jean-Michel Basquiat, at The Broad contemporary art gallery in California, USA. The African American graffiti artist had a huge impact on art from outside the traditional ecosystem. Web3 makes it easier for anyone to discover and support new talent. </figcaption></figure> Platforms are emerging that are reflective of that overlap, where collectors curate their own exhibitions and anyone can host virtual galleries to showcase art. <a href=""https://jpg.space/"" >JPG</a>, for instance, brands itself as the 'NFT Curation Protocol', allowing anyone to curate NFT exhibitions regardless of what they own. Creators can make a single repository of their work, allowing for easier discovery, or create stories with work of their own and their collaborators, whilst collectors can curate their own NFTs to guide the story of their collection, juxtaposing owned and unowned pieces to add further context and meaning. The biggest opportunity is nonetheless for curators, who can share their knowledge by spotlighting important works and creating relational and contextual meanings, all permanently on-chain.  It is the polar opposite of the traditional art world, where curators need permission from artists and owners and have to navigate gatekeepers like art institutions and gallery representatives. Factor in the logistics of flying artists to shows, shipping physical art, and coordinating with galleries too  the entire process is very slow.  In the NFT space, both creation and curation can flow unencumbered at extreme speeds. Curation in web3 is generally a more collaborative and community-driven mentality that creates a far healthier environment than the competitiveness of the traditional art world. <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:1919px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""1919px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/6304b8f8004bd6b0a67f6b1a_uniswa.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > A frame from  <a href=""https://foundation.app/@pplpleasr/foundation/13623""> x*y=k </a> , by Pplpleasr for UniSwap, the decentralised cryptocurrency exchange. The title refers to the XYK pooled liquidity model that underlies some of the technology behind the platform. </figcaption></figure> Speed and malleability, however, should not be left unchecked. We should still honour the tenets that make curators an integral part of our lives: research, lived experience, and training the eye through consistent engagement with the space. Curators in the art world live and breathe their work: it is embedded in their lifestyle and hobbies because it's the only way to absorb this world. There is  so much  to absorb in the NFT space  an impossible amount. So we need to build in opportunities that allow us to learn collectively. Platforms like JPG lean into that.  We should still honour spaces that yield profoundly imaginative artwork. We should prioritise Venice Biennale-like moments where celebrated curators gather and provide a filter through which everyone can understand, comment upon, and share in the zeitgeist. I am convinced that as established art curators continue to move into the space, we will find the balance that we need: between speed and quality, and rapid iteration and deliberate retrospection.   ""Curation in web3 is generally a more collaborative and community-driven mentality.""  As the role and definition of curator shifts in the coming years, so too will the opportunities for curatorial work. With fewer overheads and bottlenecks  physical and metaphorical  curators will have more time to work across more projects. New bridges will emerge between traditional art curation, metaverse-native projects, and everything else web3. Forward-thinking workplaces across the board  like Big Tech, for which art and aesthetics have always been key focal points  will begin to incorporate the metaverse in brand new ways. With each innovation will come curatorial opportunity.  What if your DAO could loan its Bored Ape to Google? Or you could hang your Banksy NFT in your office? Or don a VR headset to meet your team virtually in a renaissance castle? The abstract vibe' is a big factor in where we choose to work  and that is not going to change. Even as the future changes and our concepts of work and life intersect, you are still going to want art on those walls. ",1992
" ""They know that eventually, it's going to come to pass""  Zain Verjee's journey from CNN to NFTs",zain verjee,Tue Aug 02 2022 17:45:00,"Zain Verjee began her career as the midnight love show DJ in Nairobi, and made it as a towering figure in journalism during 15 years at CNN. She speaks to Leo Nasskau about swapping CNN for NFTs, what blockchain could do for journalism, and how Africa can embrace web3 to have a transformative impact on the continent. Li©a Rose Emery tells the story.",Fri Aug 05 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Communities,communities-augmented,Collectors; Advocates; Journalism,Lea Rose Emery," ""I like the idea of exploration. I like the idea of risk. I like the idea that maybe I can be a bit of a badass once in my life."" 'Once in my life' is clearly an undersell  from CNN anchor to web3 advocate, Zain Verjee has established herself as an authority in both mainstream and emerging spaces. A regular feature on the world stage  "" she hosted Bloomberg's Qatar Economic Forum in Doha last June  "" the Kenyan journalist brings an immediate tenacity and infectious enthusiasm that all began with the lonely hearts radio show on Capital FM in Nairobi.  ""I actually started off my career as a radio DJ doing the love show, which was called Love Lines, on Capital FM. My advice must have been so terrible, but I actually started on the 11:00am to 1:00am program. So I played romantic music and gave people advice when they called in. And I think I was all of about 23 years old,"" she laughs.   Her love of radio took a serious pivot when world news hit dangerously close to home.""It was August 7th, 1998, and that was the US Embassy bombings. That was a moment that catapulted me into understanding the state of the world, and looking at hard news and doing some work for the BBC."" ""Inexperienced but persistent"", Zain set her sights on CNN in Atlanta. Writing monthly asking for an opportunity, her efforts eventually paid off. After a screen test, they offered her a job on the spot, and she spent the next 15 years building a towering reputation in journalism.   The same traits of determination and focus that led her to the job of a lifetime have continued to shape her career. She now heads her own global media advisory firm, ZVG, and has taken her journalistic eye and balanced judgment to the world of web3.""I've always been someone who's passionate about the creator economy and looking at what blockchains can do, their use cases... I've seen huge potential  and huge risk, which we're all feeling  but there's something revolutionary going on and I don't want to miss it.""  For Zain, that realisation that there was something revolutionary happening came  fittingly, for a journalist  in the early days of researching. When learning more about web3, two key use cases immediately cemented themselves in her mind.""In Africa, you have a payments problem  an ah ha! moment was that there are definite use cases with blockchain and DeFi, specifically that you can apply to the continent, (such as) lower costs remittances from that diaspora across the world to Africa  and in the instant nature of transactions and efficiency and autonomy. That was a big moment for me."" <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ead3b9104d9d0ba4a17cba_2hg7JGf_fMkMVrBarllbyg3o1Gig203vUGjiJYPGTisFnmuJO0RdX1hQydMRbPRwboBESwt-Yjlc-Tzp3l2geJH17JaT5HfV8E-3SjQ%3Dw600.jpeg""  width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""> <figcaption > ""FRAU UNIVERSUM"", by  <a href=""https://twitter.com/TOBYDPHOTOGRAPH""> Tobydphotographer </a> , is one of Zain's favourite pieces in her collection. The Lagos-based artist blends modern photography with a renaissance style and depicts the connections between humanity, nature, and the wider universe. </figcaption></figure> Zain understands the fundamental importance of access  both in terms of usability and of the resources themselves. She speaks candidly about being""not a techy"" and the learning curve when educating herself about the space and draws huge inspiration from M-PESA, the fast, frictionless money service run by Vodafone that's used by 51 million people across 7 African countries.""There's not a high cost to it and it's become ingrained in our lifestyles,"" she says.""We understand it in Kenya. For cryptocurrency and web3, there's a huge education gap. People don't understand it."" That gap is something she's working to fill with her YouTube <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm89IznHN6Lep0-8wURJphg/videos"">channel</a>. But despite it, she's excited by crypto's potential, where users don't have to jump through hoops to verify ID and register in person to get financial access, or do so without relying on Vodafone as a customer.  ""We're having fibre wire data centres for greater connectivity for the entire African continent, a powerful future market that's occurring now. So whoever is in this space now is going to benefit later... We are very well poised to leapfrog any of the structure, infrastructure issues and technology issues that existed in the past (in web2, in Europe and North America) when we're looking at web3. So I'm not counting it out. I think it's going to be the greatest, most transformative force on the continent in years to come.""   While many web3 enthusiasts have been impressed by the space's potential to transform payments, Zain's background gives her a fresh perspective: What could web3 mean for journalism? It's a question she's both excited by and grappling with, drilling down into the very nature of media in an increasingly polarised and fractured world.  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth"" style=""max-width:600px"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""fullwidth"" data-rt-max-width=""600px""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62ead79d728ccdcff625c8cf_helping_hands.jpg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > ""Helping Hands"", by  <a href=""https://twitter.com/jisticslawal""> Sanjo Lawal </a> , from the artist's ORI (HEAD) collection. </figcaption></figure>""When I think of journalism, I think of stories that individuals around the world or countries around the world aren't able to get out,"" she explains.""Because journalism, it's a business, people are investing in certain kinds of (news) stories. So when you try to decentralise journalism, how do you do it? What are some of the vehicles? Is it an NFT with utility? Is it some kind of a digital membership pass that allows you to contribute to a broader community that talks about storytelling? Should it be contained within a DAO  where a community decides and votes on what stories are important and has a little bit of money sitting there that may have been generated from an NFT collection? What are the rules of good journalism there? And how do you make it participatory? And what tools can you use to check the facts?""  They're big questions  and one that she has both the experience and the curiosity to wrestle with. She is inspired by both her own experience in journalism and current developments in web3  from oracles like Chainlink and to media disruptors like Theta, to see how to make storytelling and media more democratic. And that, in part, means finding a platform for new voices. Frustrated by the reductive view that the west often takes of African artists, she's also optimistic about the power of exposure to break down stereotypes.  ""We tend to default in the West and many parts of the East into stereotypes of the African continent and a lack of understanding that actually there are 55 countries here  they're very diverse, every single one of them, in so many different ways. It's not a block, right? So when you start to see things as a block and you stereotype them, then you look at the art on OpenSea and you put that perception onto artists going, Well, it's still not African art; I don't see a tribal mask here, or I don't see some animal photography, or I don't see these bright African colours or any Ghanaian cloth'. We need to broaden our perception of the continent and therefore the perception of our artists.""  It is for this reason that Zain prefers to talk of artists from Africa' rather than African artists', noting that artists from no other continent and grouped together in the same careless way. By promoting this concept shift, Zain hopes that artists from the continent can benefit from a new wave of visibility, from eyes that really want to stick around.""When you make the effort and you actually see the talent, then it's going to blow you away. Because you discover something completely different and your stereotypes get broken as a result of that.""   Her favourite artists in the space include the Lagos-based fine arts photographers <a href=""https://twitter.com/jisticslawal"">Sanjo Lawal</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/TOBYDPHOTOGRAPH"">Tobydphotographer</a>, as well as <a href=""https://twitter.com/AkpomedayeT"">Tega</a>, who is responsible for the  Where Gods Met Humans  collection (Zain owns the artwork <a href=""https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/92049268928071124925774077369196355426283276469162609135748332571775020826625""> Chimbu Tribe </a>), and <a href=""https://twitter.com/freddiejacobart"">Freddie Jacob</a>, a queer digital artist who creates pieces""inspired by my intersectional identity.""  With determined forward momentum and a powerful sense of agency, Zain insists that""we can amplify each other, but we need people on major platforms to actively reach out and look around"". She is clearly committed to making that happen, both amplifying voices within web3 while advocating for web3 in the world at large.  <figure  class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-floatright"" style=""max-width:50%"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""floatright"" data-rt-max-width=""50%""> <img src=""https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6274d279da2ad953d38499b3/62eacecd1ccb8e9ee92e1050_photo4.jpeg"" loading=""lazy""  width=""auto"" height=""auto""> <figcaption > Zain hosted the Qatar Economic Forum last June. The Doha conference hosted 500 attendees and 75 speakers, including heads of state and global CEOs. </figcaption></figure> Anyone who feels like web3 is suffocating in an echo chamber need only turn their attention to the likes of Zain, who is equally candid about the current limitations of the space as she is about its potential. A frequent presence on the world economic stage, she carries weight as an authoritative advocate and communicator for the space. For web3, she understands the needs of the globe's leading companies and economies, and for those companies, she helps them open their minds to the opportunity in web3. ""The advocacy piece is really important to me,"" she explains.""As I learn, I'm sharing; I'm no expert. I want to be able to relate to people that are also learning and, you know, maybe a little bit intimidated as well. I learn it by doing it and if I immerse myself in it, I can communicate it."" In doing so, she's seeing the witnessing and manifesting the shift, as more key players open themselves up to the idea of web3. And she doesn't underestimate the importance of that recognition.   Last June she was in the Middle East to host the Qatar Economic Forum, which convened leading economic thinkers, business leaders and government ministers. Elon Musk joined a wide-ranging interview with John Micklethwait, Editor-in-Chief at Bloomberg News, whose parent organisation Bloomberg organised the event.""At the Qatar Economic Forum, there was definitely a recognition by all leaders  thought leaders, business leaders in their sectors, heads of state  that blockchain and crypto are here to stay. It's not a road many are open to pursuing necessarily, but they know that eventually, it's going to come to pass.""   With clear-eyed voices like Zain as authoritative advocates, the bridge between web2 and web3 feels steadier  and it's clear that she's committed to paving that road, for unheard voices and inquisitive minds alike.
